#The impact of news media information on stock prices is one common topic of interest in sentiment analysis. For this project, we aim to show a high positive correlation between positive news sentiment and positive stock price changes in the S&P500. Sentiment analysis will be performed through the use of 3 different libraries, through which the results will be published and noted for future research.
