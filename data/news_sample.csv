3174,PM,Feb-04-21,10:33AM,Philip Morris (PM) Q4 Earnings Beat Estimates on Solid Pricing, Zacks,"Philip Morris International Inc. PM reported fourth-quarter 2020 results, wherein the top and bottom lines cruised past the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the latter increased year over year. Results were backed by favorable pricing variance, mainly from higher combustible pricing. However, sales were weighed upon by adverse volume/mix due to soft cigarette shipment volumes, though heated tobacco shipment volumes were strong (thanks to strength in IQOS).Quarter in DetailAdjusted earnings per share came in at $1.26, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23. Further, the bottom line grew 3.3% year over year. On an organic basis, the bottom line increased 7.4%.Philip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurprisePhilip Morris International Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Philip Morris International Inc. QuoteNet revenues of $7,444 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,435 million. However, the top line decreased 3.5% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. Net revenues, on an organic basis, also declined 3.5%. This was due to adverse volume/mix mainly stemming from soft cigarette shipment volumes, somewhat made up by greater heated tobacco shipment volumes. The company also received some respite from favorable pricing variance (mainly from higher combustible pricing in most regions).During the fourth quarter, revenues from combustible products were down 10.9% to $5,507 million due to declines in all regions, except the European Union. Revenues in the RRPs grew 26.3% to $1,937 million.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volumes dropped 8.2% to 176.4 billion units. Cigarette shipment volumes fell 11.7% to 154.7 billion units in the quarter, while heated tobacco unit shipment volumes of 21.7 billion units jumped 26.9% year over year.Adjusted operating income rose 1.7% on an organic basis on positive pricing variance, reduced marketing, administration and research costs as well as a decline in manufacturing costs – partly countered by adverse volume/mix. Adjusted operating margin expanded 2 percentage points on an organic basis.Story continuesRegion-Wise PerformanceNet revenues in the European Union increased 12.6% to $2,742 million. Revenues climbed 6.4% at constant currency (cc), courtesy of improved volume/mix and favorable pricing variance (courtesy of increased combustible pricing). Volumes were mainly backed by a rise in heated tobacco unit volumes, somewhat countered by lower cigarette volumes. Total shipment volumes in the region slid 4.3% to 43,051 million units.In Eastern Europe, net revenues tumbled 7.5% to $908 million but grew 4.5% at cc. The upside can be attributed to favorable pricing (thanks to elevated combustible pricing), countered partly by adverse volume/mix. Total shipment volumes dropped 6% to 29,249 million units.In the Middle East & Africa region, net revenues declined 24.8% (down 21.6% at cc) to $740 million due to adverse volume/mix, partly negated by favorable pricing. Further, total shipment volumes dipped 9.3% to 30,100 million units.Revenues in South & Southeast Asia fell 20.3% (down 20.6% at cc) to $1,185 million. The downside was a result of adverse volume/mix as well as pricing variance (mainly in Indonesia). Shipment volumes collapsed 18% to 36,635 million units.Revenues from East Asia & Australia advanced 9% (up 6.1% at cc) to $1,384 million owing to pricing gains (mainly in Japan) as well as improved volume/mix. Total shipment volumes inched up 1.5% to 19,009 million units.Finally, revenues from Latin America & Canada dropped 12.5% (down 4.7% at cc) to $485 million due to adverse volume/mix, somewhat compensated by improved pricing. Moreover, total shipment volumes declined 5.9% to 18,342 million units.Other Financials & Developments on IQOSThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $7,280 million. Also, it had long-term debt of $28,168 million and shareholders’ deficit of $10,631 million.On Dec 7, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the FDA said that the company’s IQOS 3 is suitable for public health protection, and approved it for sale in the United States. Notably, a premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) for the same was filed with the FDA in March 2020. Apart from this, the FDA had approved a version of IQOS’s marketing as a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) in July 2020.IQOS delivered solid improvement in 2020, which helped drive major increases in total users, alongside boosting heated tobacco shipment as well as in-market sales volumes. Notably, total users of IQOS as of the end of full-year 2020 were estimated at 17.6 million, including 12.7 million who have shifted to IQOS and discontinued smoking.COVID-19 Update & GuidancePhilip Morris has been on track to lower the COVID-19-related business disruptions. The company notified that it currently has adequate access to inputs and is not encountering any major supply-related hurdles. All of the company’s cigarette and heated tobacco unit production units are operational globally. The pandemic doesn’t have any major impact on the availability of the company’s products to its customers and adult consumers. Further, the company has sufficient liquidity to manage business.In 2021, management expects gradual improvement in the general operating landscape. The company does not expect a near-term recovery in the duty-free business due to travel-related uncertainties. In fact, management expects the existing dynamics to persist through the end of 2021. Management further issued its 2021 guidance, considering that even in case of continued pandemic-led constraints — consumption levels will not go back to reduced levels as the second quarter of 2020. The company has entered 2021 with a positive momentum, though several hurdles related to duty-free business, pricing in Indonesia and COVID-19 impacts are likely to prevail.Additionally, total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume growth is likely to range between decline 2% to increase 1%, in 2021. Total international industry volume growth (excluding China and the United States) are estimated to be negative 3% to flat. Heated tobacco shipment volumes are envisioned in a band of 90-100 billion units in 2021 compared with the 76.1 billion units seen in full-year 2020.For 2021, Phillip Morris expects net revenues to skyrocket 407% on an organic basis, courtesy of the increasing contribution from IQOS. Adjusted operating margin on an organic basis is likely to jump at least 150 basis points in 2021. Finally, the company envisions adjusted earnings per share to be $5.90-$6. At cc, adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow 9-11% to $5.65-$5.75 from the $5.17 reported in 2020. This is likely to be fueled by revenue growth and focus on achieving cost efficiencies .For the first quarter of 2021, the company expects net revenue growth (on an organic basis) in a range of slight decline to largely stable. Management projects robust operating income margin improvement in the quarter on increased IQOS weight age in the business and continued cost savings. Based on these factors, the company envisions earnings per share of $1.40, including positive currency impact of about 9 cents.Shares of Phillip Morris have gained 13.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 12.5%.Consumer Staple Stocks to Bet OnMedifast MED, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 20.2%, on average.

8657,CTLT,Sep-09-20,10:14AM,Radius Completes Enrollment in Phase III Osteoporosis Study, Zacks,"Radius Health, Inc. RDUS announced the completion of enrollment in its “wearABLe” phase III study. The study is assessing the safety and efficacy of a wearable abaloparatide-transdermal patch in the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture compared with the current subcutaneous formulation, marketed as Tymlos.The phase III “wearABLe” abaloparatide-patch study is the first study to evaluate treatment with a novel non-injectable delivery of an anabolic therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at 12 months. The study aimed to enroll 474 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, whereas the actual number enrolled was about 500. These patients will be treated for 12 months and remain in the study for another month for safety assessment afterthe completion of 12 months of therapy.The enrollment in this study follows the completion of enrollment in the phase III study, ATOM, which is assessing the efficacy and safety of abaloparatide-SC in men with osteoporosis.Shares of the company have slumped 42.9% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 10.2%.The abaloparatide-patch was developed in a collaboration with Kindeva Drug Delivery, a spin-out of the 3M Corporation, with the application of the latter’s microstructured transdermal system. This technology innovation allows the successful delivery of peptides —abaloparatide— across the skin.This initiative was designed as a patient-centric approach and a differentiating strategy for Radius as part of a multi-year partnership with Kindeva/3M. A successful study and a subsequent regulatory approval would provide patients with a new option of abaloparatide administration. Such an option is typically not available for biological products.The successful development of the candidate and a potential approval will bring in additional funds for the company.Story continuesZacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderRadius currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include CatalentInc.

ZTS may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Zoetis is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ZTS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 88 cents per share for ZTS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ZTS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.59% heading into earnings season.Zoetis Inc.

5695,AZO,Sep-18-20,06:25AM,If You Had Bought AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) Shares Three Years Ago You'd Have Earned113% Returns, Simply Wall St.,"The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. To wit, the AutoZone, Inc. (NYSE:AZO) share price has flown 113% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. Check out our latest analysis for AutoZone There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During three years of share price growth, AutoZone achieved compound earnings per share growth of 14% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 29% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. It's not unusual to see the market 're-rate' a stock, after a few years of growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of AutoZone's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveAutoZone shareholders gained a total return of 5.6% during the year. But that return falls short of the market. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 10% over five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand AutoZone better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for AutoZone  you should be aware of.Story continuesAutoZone is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

7327,SEE,May-28-20,09:08AM,Sealed Air (SEE) Stock Down 18% YTD: Will it Bounce Back?, Zacks,"Sealed Air Corporation’s SEE focus on innovation, acquisitions, and restructuring actions are commendable. However, shares of the company have lost 17.6% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 9.7%. This downside can primarily be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on some of its end markets.What’s Weighing on the Stock?Parts of the food industry including food service and restaurants have been impacted significantly by the pandemic. The company’s fluids portfolio, which comprises innovative vertical pouch packaging for condiments, soups and sauces, has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in the food service industry. Further, many of its end markets including general manufacturing, transportation are facing slowdown or shutdowns following government restrictions and significant reduction in discretionary spending.Decelerating global industrial market amid the U.S.-China trade war has been impacting Product Care segment’s volumes for quite some time. The pandemic has added to woes. The company’s traditional packaging solutions, which include Bubble Wrap, standardized mailers, shrink film and void fill, generate around one-third of the Product Care segment’s sales. This part of the segment is bearing the brunt of the market’s shift to automation and the global industrial manufacturing slowdown. Moreover, specialty industrial applications, which include the Instapak platform and integrated fabrication solutions, account for another one-third of Product Care sales, also remains weak thanks to lower global industrial demand. Factors Likely to Drive GrowthAround 65% of Sealed Air’s revenues come from packaging of protein, foods, fluids and goods for the medical and life sciences industries. The food care business will gain from the shift in demand for case ready, shrink bags and pre-packaged meals and snacks designed for home consumption amid the pandemic-induced restrictions. In the medical and life sciences portfolio, demand for protected packaging solutions for medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, and personal protective equipment, such as monitoring systems, ventilators, mask and COVID-19 test kits remains high.Story continuesFurther, e-commerce sales, which contribute around 13% to the company’s sales, have been on the rise amid the stay-at-home scenario. Thus, with more than 75% of the company’s revenues originating from end-markets that are deemed essential and supporting the stay-at-home environment amid the pandemic, it will help sustain the top-line performance.In December 2018, Sealed Air announced a reformation plan — Reinvent SEE Strategy — along with a fresh restructuring program, in a move to drive growth. The new strategy is focused on innovations, SG&A productivity, product-cost efficiency, channel optimization and customer-service enhancements. The company is on track to realize 110 million of incremental benefits to adjusted EBITDA in 2020 compared with the prior year. This will help sustain margins despite weakness in certain end markets.Further, innovation, acquisitions and investments that the company has been making to its core business will drive growth. Few notable buyouts made by the company include Automated Packaging Systems, Inc., AFP, Inc and Fagerdala.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderSealed Air currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Industrial Products sector are The ExOne Company XONE, Silgan Holdings Inc. SLGN and Broadwind Energy, Inc. BWEN. While ExOne and Silgan sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Broadwind Energy carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ExOne has an estimated earnings growth rate of 15% for the ongoing year.

14980,DOV,Oct-23-20,06:39AM,Results: Dover Corporation Beat Earnings Expectations And Analysts Now Have New Forecasts, Simply Wall St.,"Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) defied analyst predictions to release its third-quarter results, which were ahead of market expectations. It was overall a positive result, with revenues beating expectations by 6.6% to hit US$1.7b. Dover also reported a statutory profit of US$1.38, which was an impressive 21% above what the analysts had forecast. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. With this in mind, we've gathered the latest statutory forecasts to see what the analysts are expecting for next year. View our latest analysis for Dover earnings-and-revenue-growthTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Dover's 14 analysts is for revenues of US$6.98b in 2021, which would reflect a credible 4.5% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to swell 18% to US$5.49. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$6.90b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.23 in 2021. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Dover's earnings potential following these results.There's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$126, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Dover analyst has a price target of US$136 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$108. The narrow spread of estimates could suggest that the business' future is relatively easy to value, or thatthe analysts have a strong view on its prospects.Story continuesOne way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. It's clear from the latest estimates that Dover's rate of growth is expected to accelerate meaningfully, with the forecast 4.5% revenue growth noticeably faster than its historical growth of 0.5%p.a. over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.3% per year. So it's clear that despite the acceleration in growth, Dover is expected to grow meaningfully slower than the industry average.The Bottom LineThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Dover's earnings potential next year. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply revenues will perform worse than the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$126, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Dover going out to 2024, and you can see them free on our platform here..Don't forget that there may still be risks. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Dover  that you should be aware of.This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

12528,LUMN,Jan-14-21,12:10PM,Can CenturyLink (LUMN) Keep the Earnings Surprise Streak Alive?, Zacks,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? CenturyLink (LUMN), which belongs to the Zacks Wireless National industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This communications company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 30.14%.For the last reported quarter, CenturyLink came out with earnings of $0.40 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.31 per share, representing a surprise of 29.03%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.32 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.42 per share, delivering a surprise of 31.25%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor CenturyLink, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.CenturyLink has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 10, 2021.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

11812,UAA,Dec-23-20,08:55AM,"Mark Tepper Weighs In On General Electric, Under Armour And More", Benzinga,"On CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" Mark Tepper of Strategic Wealth Partners spoke about Under Armour Inc (NYSE: UAA), General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), American Airlines Group Inc (NYSE: AAL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE: HPE) and Gap Inc (NYSE: GPS). These five stocks are priced at less than $25 and they have outperformed the market this quarter.Tepper sees some potential only in Under Armour because he loves the end market. He sees it as a turnaround story in a very attractive market. The company has its issues. It lacks innovation and compression shirts were really cool 20 years ago, said Tepper. It hasn't done much since then. Tepper could get interested in Under Armour, but he needs to see some stability in management and also some innovation on the product side.He looks at General Electric as a company with an identity crisis so the stock is not something he wants to own.American Airlines is not very efficient so he prefers Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL).Tepper believes the best is behind Hewlett Packard Enterprise as he expects sales to slow down going forward.Gap Inc has been shrinking so he would rather own TJX Companies Inc (NYSE: TJX).Fairlead Strategies' Katie Stockton believes these stocks are unlikely to outperform in the near term given the January effect which favours stocks that have lagged in December. She sees some long-term potential for these names.See more from BenzingaClick here for options trades from BenzingaJeff Kilburg's NASDAQ-100 Futures TradeJosh Brown Discusses Bernstein's Bullish Call On Uber© 2020 Benzinga.com.

The company is currently also targeting an expansion across Asia.MGM has been instrumental in “giving back to the community” and last year alone, donated 552,000 meals in Southern Nevada alone and leveraged their significant expertise to support Nevada’s COVID-19 taskforce with 261,000 hospital gowns, 200,000 medical gloves and 500,000 KN95 respiratory mask.The multi-layered, Seven-Point Safety Plan that was implemented prior to re-opening its resorts after the coronavirus lockdowns was one of the first of its kind, and the company is committed to the fight to stop the spread of the virus.“We’re proud of the work we’ve done to adapt and continually provide unmatched guest service through this period of uncertainty,” said Bill Hornbuckle, CEO & President of MGM Resorts International. “Furthermore, as a long-standing leader in the hospitality and entertainment business, we take seriously our Social Impact and Sustainability obligations and brand reputation as we strive to make the world a better place.” (See MGM stock analysis on TipRanks)Goldman Sachs analyst Stephen Grambling reiterated his Sell rating on MGM two weeks ago but raised his price target to $27 from $23.

8056,CPB,Oct-26-20,01:57PM,Walmart CEO: The lack of stimulus is taking its toll, Yahoo Finance,"Attention lawmakers: get a new stimulus done now, because your dillydallying is hurting U.S. consumers and businesses.“I think the lack of stimulus is showing up more so with those unemployed, small businesses and people that need help. I think it’s important that we all understand in some ways we are having a shared experience because we are in a pandemic together, but we are having a very different experience. If you have been let go and don’t have income, you really need help. The voice we have at Walmart is to say to Congress and the administration we need you to help those people who need help,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit.Stimulus from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act in the form of an unemployment payment top up and direct checks to people greatly helped Walmart and the broader retail sector in the spring.Walmart’s U.S. same-store sales surged 9.3% in the second quarter, led by general merchandise and food. Rivals such as Target, Kroger and Albertson’s also saw outsized quarterly sales gains. But consumer spending slowed down into September — and now into October — as stimulus has run its course. The lack of stimulus —and any insight into when a new deal will get passed amid a contentious election season —stands to highlight the struggles of lower income Americans in coming months.COCONUT CREEK, FL - APRIL 04: Shoppers stock up as Walmart on Saturday began limiting the number of customers who can be in it's stores at once due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on April 4, 2020 in Coconut Creek, Florida Credit: mpi04/MediaPunch /IPXAmong lower-income Americans, a recent Pew Research study showed that 46% surveyed had trouble paying their bills since the pandemic began. Roughly one-third have had difficulty making rent or mortgage payments.The financial stress stems from how the pandemic has uprooted the U.S. economy, leading to sweeping layoffs. Pew found that 25% of adults say they or someone in their household was laid off or lost a job due to the pandemic. Roughly 15% said job loss happened to them personally.Despite the economic uncertainty, McMillon is hopeful on the crucial holiday shopping season.Story continues“I think people want to celebrate the holiday. Hopefully families will take steps to do that in a safe manner. But we all need some love and joy, and this time of year brings those things top of mind. We’ll find a way to celebrate it and it will be a good year. It will be unique, but a good year,” says McMillon.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-anchor of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.

6823,BLK,Feb-10-21,11:39PM,"Exclusive: Goldman, other financial firms add China staff, eyeing growth", Reuters,"By Scott Murdoch and Samuel ShenHONG KONG (Reuters) - Global financial firms including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and Fidelity International are poised to add hundreds of staff in China this year as they look to take advantage of the opening up of its $40 trillion financial sector.Beijing in the last one-and-a-half years stepped up the pace of liberalisation mainly as part of a trade deal with the United States, and allowed foreigners to fully own their local ventures in areas including investment banking and asset management.After having won regulatory approval to raise holdings and dealt with the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Western firms are now readying plans to boost their onshore presence, representatives and headhunters said.Foreign financial firms have long coveted a bigger presence in China, and their expansion comes against the backdrop of a revival in its economy, increased onshore deal activities, and a rapid pace of wealth creation.Goldman is leading the charge of the Wall Street banks operating in China - the first to move towards taking full ownership of its securities business after it was fully opened up to foreigners last April.It aims to hire 70 staff in China in 2021, a Goldman spokesman said, as it seeks to double headcount to 600 by 2024. The bank has about 400 staff now and the new hiring round will target investment bankers, brokers, analysts and technology staff.Fidelity tripled its office space in Shanghai in September to accommodate a fast-growing workforce as it prepares to launch its wholly owned mutual fund unit after China scrapped foreign ownership caps in the sector last year.The fund manager plans to hire around 100 people in China this year, not including its operation and technology centre in Dalian, the company told Reuters.""We hope to hire high-end talents with both global perspective and local insight, which is in short supply in the current market,"" it said.Story continuesBlackRock, which is setting up a 51%-controlled wealth management venture with Temasek Holdings and China Construction Bank Corp in China, is hiring at least a dozen senior roles for the business, according to global recruiting site Glassdoor.Vacancies include vice president of trading, vice president of marketing strategy, head of risk and quantitative analysis and fund operation manager, according to newly posted job ads over the past month.BlackRock declined to comment.TALENT WARBesides opening up of its financial sectors for foreigners, Beijing also initiated a slew of reforms in the last couple of years across capital markets, asset management and insurance businesses, boosting the earnings prospects of Western firms.That has also resulted in increased activities in the Chinese financial market - Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market was ranked fourth last year in the global bourses league table with $20.3 billion worth of deals in 2020, according to Refinitiv.The hiring plans have raised the prospect of a talent war with most looking to raid other foreign firms in China. Some of them are also looking to tap into their existing staff in other locations to build out their China workforce.Goldman, for example, is planning to hire domestically while also tapping overseas talent networks to find the 70 new staff, the spokesman said.UBS China country head David Chin said the jostle to hire staff by Western financial firms had not only triggered a talent war but meant banks had to work hard to stop their staff being poached by rivals.UBS said in January it was planning to double its investment banking workforce in three to five years.""Of course, we regularly transfer employees from Hong Kong to China but it needs to be done in a measured way. Many Hong Kong employees are not the best fit for mainland China, so the number of prospective candidates is limited,"" Chin said.(Reporting by Scott Murdoch in Hong Kong and Samuel Shen in Shanghai; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee)",finance.yahoo.com,1
8967,SNPS,Feb-12-21,04:44AM,"Are Strong Financial Prospects The Force That Is Driving The Momentum In Synopsys, Inc.'s NASDAQ:SNPS) Stock?", Simply Wall St.,"Synopsys' (NASDAQ:SNPS) stock is up by a considerable 27% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Synopsys'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Synopsys How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Synopsys is:14% = US$663m ÷ US$4.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2020).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.14 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Synopsys' Earnings Growth And 14% ROETo begin with, Synopsys seems to have a respectable ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 13% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Synopsys' exceptional 26% net income growth seen over the past five years. However, there could also be other drivers behind this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesNext, on comparing Synopsys' net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 29% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Synopsys is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Synopsys Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Synopsys' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

10296,CI,Nov-02-20,07:35AM,Forget Bargain Hunting: Play 5 Stocks With Rising P/E, Zacks,"Bargain hunting or looking for stocks with a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is among the widely used investing strategies. Investors believe that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock. The logic is simple — a stock’s current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside.But there is more to this whole P/E story as not only low P/E, stocks with a rising P/E can also fetch solid returns.Rising P/E: An Useful ToolGenerally, the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings. As forecasts for expected earnings move higher, demand for the stock should drive its price. After all, astock's P/E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out for every dollar of earnings. Thus, if the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company’s inherent strength.Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year’s actual growthPercentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to zero(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than the percentage change in price over 12 weeksPercentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes.)Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500Story continuesPercentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S&P 500 greater than the percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S&P 500(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500.)Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20% higher than or equal to the percentage price change for 24 weeks, but it should not exceed 100%(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal.)In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) can get through.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7,700 stocks to just seven.Here are five of the seven stocks:Cigna Corporation CI: Cigna is the result of a merger between Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (CG) and Insurance Company of North America (INA). The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Cohbar Inc.

10202,CI,Feb-10-21,10:46PM,Positivity Around Vaccine Roll-Out and Future Availability Leads to Improved Perceptions on Whole Health, PR Newswire,"Cigna's COVID-19 Global Impact Study shows early access to vaccine may create a brighter outlookHONG KONG, Feb. 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Cigna's (NYSE:CI) International Markets business today published the fifth edition of its COVID-19 Global Impact Study, which highlights the contrast in well-being around the world as vaccine roll-out commenced for some, while other markets anticipated vaccine approvals to come. With the COVID-19 pandemic continually evolving and new waves and variants emerging in different geographies, these latest results show the initial impact of vaccine availability, and highlight a growing nostalgia for the normalcies of pre-pandemic way of life.Cigna Logo (PRNewsfoto/Cigna)Building on the previous wave of results from October, which saw many markets reach record lows, this latest study was conducted in late November and early December 2020, and gauged global attitudes to five health indices - family, financial, physical, social and work. The study's timing coincided with one vaccine already being administered in UAE, following emergency approval in September and at a time when the first, highly anticipated approval for a vaccine was imminent in the U.K.Thailand fell by 1.4 points, amid its largest single outbreak, as well as Spain and Hong Kong, which saw continued record lows as pandemic-associated stay-at-home orders continued. However, a different picture emerged in markets where the vaccine deployment had commenced, or approval was imminent. The UAE and U.K. saw increases of 1.8 and 1.6 points, respectively. These increases were only surpassed in New Zealand and Taiwan, where COVID-19 restrictions were considered successful and had been almost entirely lifted, with overall scores improving by 2.7 and 2.5 points, respectively.Jason Sadler, President, Cigna International Markets said: ""We predicted that vaccine availability would have a direct impact on people's physical well-being as they received the immunization, but we are also seeing a broader positive impact for whole health. As global vaccine distribution moves forward and the rollout continues, it will be increasingly critical that all parties involved help to manage the expectations of their citizens, especially those not in priority groups, to help ensure a continued focus on our populations' well-being.""Story continuesCraving Normalcy The desire for pre-pandemic normalcy is also seen in people's preferences for remote vs. office working. In mid- 2020, at the end of the first waves of the pandemic in most markets, the data reflects an overwhelming preference for remote working globally, as people enjoyed the flexibility and family time it offered. This latest study reveals that this novelty has begun to wear off and many people are beginning to crave a return to some form of normality, with 53 percent of people surveyed now wanting to work from the office at least 80 percent of the time. The key reasons stated for this were more effective communication, better team collaboration and better productivity.Health Fatigue Sets InWith the pandemic ongoing for approximately one year now depending on geography, along with new and varying waves of restrictions, the data also reflects increases in health fatigue. At the beginning of the pandemic, rates of physical exercise rose in many markets. However, by December 2020, rates declined in a number of markets – notably in the United States, which fell from 32 percent in October to 24 percent in December; in Thailand, which fell from 27 percent to 21 percent; and in Singapore, where it fell from 22 percent to 17 percent.Sadler added, ""The enduring nature of the pandemic is showing that some of the positive habits many people established at the onset may be waning. People are looking back to life before the pandemic, especially from a work perspective, as the pressure of work, family, home-schooling and other responsibilities are being felt.""Family Time Improves in Many MarketsDespite the declines in physical well-being, overall family well-being scores have remained robust in most markets. When asked about their ability to spend quality time with their family, 40 percent of people surveyed said it was either excellent or very good. In many markets, results in this area have been more positive since the last study in October. In the UAE, 57 percent of people said they had high-quality family time in December compared to only 53 percent in October; in Spain it improved from 46 percent to 50 percent; in the UK it improved from 32 percent to 39 percent and in Singapore it improved from 30 percent to 37 percent.People say they feel more able to take care of their loved ones. When specifically asked about their ability to take care of their spouse or partner's health and well-being, 54 percent of people in the UK said it was excellent or very good, compared to 49 percent in October. In the UAE, it increased from 48 percent in October to 64 percent in December and in Spain it remained steady at 54 percent.""The continued focus on family continues, which we hope will be a long-term benefit from the pandemic. Although people's lives have changed significantly as they have adapted traditional roles of employee, partner, parent, carer and educator, for many, it has resulted in a greater connection with loved ones and potentially an improvement in their well-being,"" Sadler said.Changing Models of HealthSince the beginning of 2020, different models of care have become embedded in our new normal. Notably, virtual health is now a widely accepted part of mainstream healthcare delivery in many markets across the world. Fifty-nine percent of people surveyed say they would choose to have a diagnosis virtually, compared to only 41 percent pre-pandemic. However, when asked how likely they would be to use virtual care if they could connect with their regular doctor, 73 percent of people said they would be receptive, rising to 88 percent in Thailand and the UAE, and 86 percent in Taiwan.The trend toward increased utilization of health and well-being apps seems set to continue with 80 percent of people globally now reporting that they would consider or would prefer virtual rather than face-to-face engagement when it comes to general health advice, such as nutrition and lifestyle tips. There also continues to be strong interest in virtual health for mental health support, such as therapy and counselling, with 69 percent of people globally saying they would consider or would prefer virtual consultations, opening up the potential to rapidly expand mental health provision across the world.Sadler concluded, ""The experience of the last year has profoundly changed people's expectations of healthcare with many now preferring to speak to clinicians virtually, rather than face to face. This presents a clear opportunity to adapt the healthcare journey for patients in the future, especially for general health, mental health and well-being support, delivering improved health outcomes for all in a way that works best for them as an individual.""Click here to download Cigna's COVID-19 Global Impact Study – 5th EditionTo download our previous reports please visit:Click here for the Cigna COVID-19 Global Impact Study – 1st EditionClick here for the Cigna COVID-19 Global Impact Study – 2nd EditionClick here for the Cigna COVID-19 Global Impact Study – 3rd EditionClick here for the Cigna COVID-19 Global Impact Study – 4th EditionHow the study was conducted: The Cigna COVID-19 Global Impact Study is an ongoing study that has been conducted by Cigna, in partnership with Kantar.

BXP recently inked a long-term lease with Translate Bio, a clinical-stage messenger RNA therapeutics company, for 138,000 square feet of space at 200 West Street in Waltham, MA. Following this deal, the property is fully leased.Notably, the strategic location of the property in a submarket popular among preeminent and emerging life sciences, biotechnology and technology companies, and redevelopment efforts at the building to offer modern work space might have attracted the tenant to lease the property for 10 years.Specifically, 200 West Street is being revamped to offer a variety of lab space, including cold rooms and pilot, chemistry and biology labs, with anticipated completion in 2021. Moreover, it can be expanded in future with around 130,000 square feet of additional developable life science space.Moreover, the property holds a full service cafe, offers fitness and conference facilities, and convenient access to the highly-skilled workforce in Waltham and neighboring towns that can be beneficial to the tenant.Per management, “Translate Bio’s selection underscores our commitment to providing biotech customers the most flexible, modern and creative work environments to discover and develop therapies that increase wellness and improve lives.”Markedly, in light of global efforts to develop vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus, there is higher demand for drug innovation. Leveraging on these factors that are also driving sector fundamentals, Boston Properties is focusing on development of commercial properties for the life sciences sector.Through such efforts, the company existing portfolio comprises 3.3 million square feet of properties leased by biotechnology, healthcare and medical device companies.

12431,LOW,Dec-11-20,02:18PM,The Government of Canada welcomes report from Industry Strategy Council, CNW Group,"The Council's work has already helped inform the government's actions, including the extension of the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and some measures outlined in the Fall Economic StatementOTTAWA, ON, Dec. 11, 2020 /CNW/ - The Government of Canada recognizes that a smooth economic recovery will require continued collaboration between the public and private sectors in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. That is why the government created the Industry Strategy Council, bringing together business leaders to offer experienced perspectives from key sectors of our economy and to engage with a diverse set of businesses and stakeholders from coast to coast to coast, including labour and Indigenous peoples.Today, the Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, welcomed a report from the Council's Chair, Monique F. Leroux. While the Council has provided advice throughout its mandate, the report serves as a summary and conclusion of its work, which focused specifically on identifying the scope and depth of COVID-19's impact on industries and informing the government's understanding of specific sectoral pressures. In addition, the Council has outlined recommendations to support the recovery and growth of key sectors moving forward. The Minister thanked the Chair and each member of the Council for the time and energy they have put into this initiative.The Council provided valuable insight into pain points within sectors, noting the importance of support for heavily affected sectors. Looking at the longer term, the Council provided additional recommendations on connectivity, skills training, diversity and inclusion, research and development, and steps toward sustainability and lower emissions. In consultation with the Council, business communities and Canadians, the government has taken swift action on some of these themes. Beyond the priority of fighting COVID-19 and protecting Canadians, the Fall Economic Statement outlined measures for supporting workers and businesses through the second wave as well as our hardest-hit sectors.Story continuesThe report, Restart, Recover and Reimagine Prosperity for All Canadians: An Ambitious Growth Plan for Building a Digital, Sustainable and Innovative Economy, details findings on COVID-19's impact on industries and added recommendations to position for recovery across sectors.Quotes""Our first priority remains to protect and support Canadians through this pandemic. To do so, we need first to understand the shifting and serious effects of the pandemic on our industrial sectors. Canadian business leaders on the Industry Strategy Council have helped with just that, sharing changes and challenges to industry from across Canada and sectors. Their insights have informed our government's work to support workers and businesses, and we look forward to continued collaboration to help all Canadians through the COVID-19 pandemic, without losing ground on issues that will allow us to recover with more opportunities for all Canadians.""– The Honourable Navdeep Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry""It is an honour to present to Canadians our report designed to shape our country's economic outlook amidst this COVID-19 pandemic. We wrote this report in a spirit of dialogue between our industry leaders and government experts, through broad public consultations. These important insights have galvanized our desire to structure our economic recovery to benefit all Canadians and have urged us to be bold and ambitious in taking action to enhance our national competitiveness. This crisis calls for Canadians to stand together in building a promising future for the prosperity of all."" – Monique F. Leroux, Chair, Industry Strategy CouncilQuick factsThe Industry Strategy Council drew its inspiration from the innovative collaborative model that was established through the Economic Strategy Tables (EST), set up in October 2017 as part of the government's Innovation and Skills Plan.The Council's composition aligned with that of the ESTs, representing key industries: advanced manufacturing, agri-food, clean technology, digital industries, health and biosciences, resources of the future, and tourism and hospitality, adding two new tables for the retail and transportation sectors in response to economic pressures caused by the pandemic.The ESTs will relaunch in the near future, building on the Council's insights on the current state of key sectors and potential recommendations for the future.Associated linksMinister Bains announces members of new Industry Strategy CouncilIndustry Strategy CouncilEconomic Strategy TablesCoronavirus disease (COVID-19)Stay connectedFollow Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada on Twitter: @ISED_CASOURCE Innovation, Science and Economic Development CanadaCisionView original content: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/December2020/11/c2325.html",finance.yahoo.com,0
339,NSC,Oct-21-20,02:34PM,New technology joint venture to transform rail shipping, PR Newswire,"NORFOLK, Va., Oct. 21, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Today Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC), GATX Corporation, Genesee & Wyoming, TrinityRail, and Watco announced a venture to create a new technology platform that will help transform rail shipping in the 21st century. The new venture, Rail Pulse, will facilitate and accelerate the adoption of GPS and other telematics technology across the North American railcar fleet.The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided leadership in a successful Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements grant application. In addition to this Federal Railroad Administration funding, investments will be made by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the venture members to support the development of this platform.The Rail Pulse partners, who collectively own nearly 20% of the North American railcar fleet, are seeking to accelerate the adoption of telematics to meet two specific objectives. The first objective of Rail Pulse is safety. Early phases of the platform will incorporate hand brake and impact data, both of which could provide important safety data for the railroads, car owners, and shippers alike. Future telematics capabilities – such as onboard bearing temperature and wheel impact detection sensors – are envisioned as the technology evolves.The second objective is to increase rail's competitive position relative to other modes by improving visibility into the status, location, and condition of individual railcars, which will meaningfully contribute to rail industry growth. Telematics capabilities will include data capture to support real-time track-level visibility, whether doors or hatches are open, whether the car is loaded or partially loaded, and other key performance metrics.The companies behind Rail Pulse are launching this venture for the benefit of the entire rail ecosystem: shippers, Class I railroads, short lines, regional railroads, switching carriers and railcar operating lessors. Rail Pulse intends to provide a neutral, open-architecture, industry-wide railcar telematics platform to make it easier to ship by rail and to track rail shipments across the North American rail network, all while ensuring the safety and security of proprietary car-owner data.Story continues""Rail Pulse is another example of how the freight rail industry is using advanced technology to enhance safety and service to shippers,"" said Jennie Granger, PennDOT Deputy Secretary for Multimodal Transportation. ""PennDOT is proud of the strong partnership we have with the freight rail industry, and we look forward to this platform being implemented throughout the North American railcar fleet.""The partners will begin development of the platform later this year, with a full-service platform targeted for availability to the North American railcar industry by the end of 2022.The partners extend their gratitude to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao and FRA Administrator Ronald Batory for their leadership in making this CRISI grant a reality for Rail Pulse. The partners also extend their gratitude to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for its sponsorship in this endeavor.CisionView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-technology-joint-venture-to-transform-rail-shipping-301157273.htmlSOURCE Norfolk Southern Corporation",finance.yahoo.com,1
12724,CSX,Dec-28-20,08:43AM,These 4 Railroad Stocks Are on Track to Rebound in 2021, Zacks,"As the health of the railroad industry is closely tied to the global economy, the coronavirus pandemic weighed heavily on railroad operations. A major economic downturn hurt volumes, thus causing a decline in freight revenues, which contribute the majority of railroad players’ top lines.Since the reopening of economies in May, railroad players have been gradually recovering from the coronavirus-induced slump as freight market conditions improve. While volumes for most railroads remain below year-ago levels, it indicates a substantial increase from the pandemic-driven lows in April and early May.AAR Data Shows Continued Improvement in Rail TrafficWeekly rail traffic data released by the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) shows consistent improvement in railroad volumes (carloads) over the past few months. After dipping 2.1% year over year for the week ending Sep 26, 2020, U.S. rail traffic (including intermodal) hit the positive territory in October with volumes (rail carloads and intermodal units) inching up 0.8% year over year for the week ending Oct 3, 2020. The uptrend has continued so far with carloads and intermodal units up 2.5% per AAR’s latest rail traffic release for the week ending Dec 19, 2020. However, when intermodal volumes are excluded, rail traffic remained below year-ago levels. For the week ending Dec 19, rail carloads were down 5.8% year over year.Clearly, intermodal volumes are making up for the lost ground. Another key contributor to this upward trend in rail traffic has been grain volumes. While import volumes and Internet purchasing by consumers are causing an increase in intermodal volumes, rising soybean exports are boosting grain volumes.Rail traffic should continue to increase in 2021 as economic recovery picks up pace on vaccine hopes (currently coronavirus vaccines are being rolled out in the United States).Other Tailwinds Likely to Benefit Railroads in 2021Story continuesAmid coronavirus-induced volume softness, the precision scheduled railroading (“PSR”) model,an operating structure that reduces costs, enhances services and leads to optimal asset utilization, is providing a cushion to railroads. Reduced costs and increased efficiency from the PSR model is supporting railroads’ bottom line. The benefits are likely to amplify in 2021 as volume woes ease.Additionally, 2021 is expected to make evident the benefits of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) agreement. The trade deal, which came into effect in July 2020, replaces the 25-year old North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”). It streamlines North American trade and is expected to boost volumes for railroads. The coronavirus pandemic clouded the effects of the trade deal in 2020.Moody’s Upgraded Outlook for Railroads Adds to the PositivityMoody's Investors Service’s revised outlook for North American railroads further supports our upbeat take on railroads for 2021.With gradually recovering freight volumes, the credit rating agency has changed the outlook for railroads to stable from negative. Moody's anticipates growth in shipments of most types of freight to pick up over the next 12 to 18 months. The volume growth is anticipated to be led by intermodal. The stable outlook is reflective of revenue growth of 4.2-6% for railroads over the next year or so, stated Moody's vice president Rene Lipsch.4 Railroad Stocks Poised for a Recovery in 2021Against the buoyant backdrop, the below-mentioned railroad stocks look poised for a rebound in 2021. Each of the stocks mentioned below carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.CSX Corporation CSX: This is a leading transportation company offering rail-based freight transportation services like traditional rail service, transport of intermodal containers and trailers. Reduced costs (down 12% year over year in the first nine months of 2020) primarily due to low fuel prices and increased efficiency are aiding the company.With the economy recovering, intermodal volumes rebounded for CSX in the third quarter of 2020. After an 11% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, volumes increased 7% in the third quarter with both domestic and international shipments increasing as a result of tightening truck capacity among other factors. Intermodal volumes should continue to increase as market conditions improve further. With the freight scene picking up, the company is expected to see improvement in its merchandise volumes in 2021 as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 4.1% in the past 90 days.Kansas City Southern KSU:  Based in Kansas City, MO, this is a transportation holding company that has railroad investments in the United States, Mexico and Panama. With ramp up in economic activities, the company is seeing a gradual recovery in volumes. On the third-quarter conference call, it stated that at the end of the third quarter of 2020, volumes were approximately 60% higher than the lows in early May. Kansas City Southern expects volumes to keep improving in the fourth quarter and in 2021.Moreover, increased efficiency and reduced costs, courtesy of the PSR model, is supporting the company’s bottom line. Kansas City Southern’s earnings (on a reported basis) increased 15.6% year over year in the first nine months of 2020, despite substantial decline in revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2021 earnings has been revised northward by 2.7% in the past 90 days.Canadian Pacific Railway Limited CP: Headquartered in Calgary, Canada, this company operates a transcontinental railway network in Canada and the United States. It focuses on providing logistics and supply chain expertise services.The company is benefiting from strong performance with respect to grain movement. In November, Canadian Pacific moved 2.96 million metric tonnes (MMT) of Canadian grain and grain products, breaking its November 2019 record by 8%. This follows another record-setting month in October, when it transported 3.04 MMT of Canadian grain and grain products, the first time ever that Canadian Pacific exceeded 3MMT in a month.Additionally, with gradual recovery in freight-market conditions, Canadian Pacific’s automotive business rebounded significantly in the third quarter. After a massive 67.3% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, automotive revenues rose 8% in the third quarter with volumes rising 11%. Heading into 2021, this recovery process should gain momentum.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 5% in the past 90 days.Canadian National Railway Company CNI: Based in Montreal, Canada, the company is engaged in the rail and related transportation business. The company's rail network serves major Canadian ports and includes connections to the United States. Despite freight softness, Canadian National’s Grain and Fertilizers segment has continued to perform impressively. With the company having moved record volumes of Canadian grain, revenues from Grain and Fertilizers segment increased 5% in the first nine months of 2020.In November, the company moved more than 3MMT of Canadian grain, marking its ninth straight month of record grain movement. As the economy continues to recover in 2021, other segments within freight should see an improvement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 2.1% in the past 90 days.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2021In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 top tickers for the entirety of 2021?These 10 are painstakingly hand-picked from over 4,000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank.

1344,ORLY,Aug-25-20,01:15PM,Why OReilly Automotive (ORLY) Stock is a Compelling Investment Case, Insider Monkey,"Qualivian Investment Partners recently released its Q2 2020 Investor Letter, a copy of which you can download here. The fund's performance in Q2 was ahead of the S&P 500 by 9.6% and 9.5% on a gross and net basis. You should check out Qualivian Investment Partners' top 5 stock picks for investors to buy right now, which could be the biggest winners of the stock market crash.In the said letter, Qualivian Investment Partners highlighted a few stocks and O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) is one of them. O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) is an auto parts retailer. Year-to-date, O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) stock gained 6.0% and on August 24th it had a closing price of $463.91. Here is what Qualivian Investment Partners said:""O’Reilly: ORLY's Q2 2020 results were above even the most bullish expectations. While it began the quarter slowly, it reported same-store sales growth of 16.2%. This was significantly more than the consensus estimate of -2.3%. ORLY’s Do-It-Yourself business was extremely strong in Q2 and outpaced the Do-It-For-Me segment. This performance was impressive even though a key driver of industry demand (miles driven) has been under pressure. The offset was a shift away from public transit, air travel, and ridesharing. ORLY resumed share repurchases in May, highlighting confidence in its liquidity position and outlook.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) is the leading auto parts retailer in the US and it focuses on meeting the needs of two distinct customer segments: the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) customer (57% of sales) and the Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) segment (43% of sales), which is comprised of auto repair shops, service stations and dealers.The auto parts market (total size of $300 billion with ORLY’s TAM of $100 billion) is still highly fragmented but has been consolidating over the past decade, forming an oligopolistic structure with the top 3 companies representing over 43% of the store counts and the top 5 companies representing 50%. We anticipate that concentration will continue to increase as scale gives the larger players an advantage in terms of distribution, technology, purchasing, and branding.We believe ORLY can continue to consistently compound earnings growth at a mid-teens plus level for the foreseeable future, leveraging 7%-8% topline growth into low-to mid-teens growth in after-tax earnings, and using their share repurchase program to ultimately deliver mid-teens plus EPS growth over our investment horizon.Valuation• ORLY is currently trading at 21.5X NTM5 P/E and 1.0X NTM relative P/E to the market, somewhat richer compared to its historical ranges in absolute terms and quite a bit cheaper on relative terms.• ORLY has historically traded at a premium to the S&P 500 given its superior growth and return profile: ─ 10-Year average for NTM P/E: 19.8X (with a range of 16.8X to 22.7X at +/- 1SD around the mean). ─ 10-year average for NTM P/E relative to the S&P500: 1.3X (with a range of 1.1X to 1.5X at +/- 1SD around the mean).ORLY meets our requirements of being a quality compounder: (1) it has sustainable competitive advantage, (2) has good reinvestment opportunities, and (3) has demonstrated excellent capital allocation. More specifically:Competitive Advantages:• Founder-Led Culture: the founder’s grandson, David O’Reilly, has been with the company since 1972 where he rotated through all the company’s major business operations, eventually becoming its President and CEO in 1993, before becoming Chairman in 2005, when he gave up day-to-day oversight of the company. Management today carry on the founder’s mantra of putting the customer first above all else and manage the business on that basis.• Better Distribution System: ORLY pioneered and leads the auto parts industry in building its hub and spoke distribution center, hub and retail store network, giving them an advantage in being able to quickly supply auto parts at industry leading levels of service and product availability.─ This is key in all retail businesses but especially important in the Professional/DIFM segment, where mechanics need parts within a few hours so that they can reduce their wait times and turnaround their jobs more quickly and improve revenue productivity.• Higher Customer Satisfaction via Greater Investments in IT:─ Furthermore, ORLY has been leading the auto parts sector in investing in its Omni Channel capability to expand order fulfillment options for its DIY and DIFM customers via instore, call-in or online ordering channels.─ COVID has accelerated the investments the company has made in its “Buy Online and Pickup in Store” process which is becoming a key differentiator across the retail space.Good Reinvestment Opportunities• Stable End-Market Drivers: Spending on auto repairs and maintenance is relatively stable and predictable and is a function of miles driven, light vehicle population, and fleet age.• Store Growth: Furthermore, ORLY is underrepresented in key Northeast markets and has been growing store counts organically at a rate of 150-200 stores per year for the last 15 years, which represent roughly 3% to its topline organic growth.Excellent Capital Allocation• Opportunistic Acquirer: Typically, ORLY has supplemented its organic store growth via smaller opportunistic acquisitions, however in 2008 it acquired CSK which doubled its store count and gave it the scale to get an order of magnitude improvement in its purchasing leverage from vendors. Given the size and conservativism of its balance sheet, ORLY has the capacity to entertain another sizeable acquisition at the right price to further consolidate the market and improve its positioning within it.• Share Repurchases: Management returns excess cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and since the inception of the program in 2011 has bought back a little over 70 million shares, or approximately $13.0bn cumulatively, shrinking the share count by 46%.""Story continuesCopyright: urfingus / 123RF Stock PhotoIn Q1 2020, the number of bullish hedge fund positions on O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) stock decreased by about 6% from the previous quarter (see the chart here), so a number of other hedge fund managers don't seem to agree with ORLY's growth potential. Our calculations showed that O'Reilly Automotive Inc (NASDAQ:ORLY) isn't ranked among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds.The top 10 stocks among hedge funds returned 185% since the end of 2014 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index ETFs by more than 109 percentage points.

11115,CMS,Jan-28-21,12:10PM,Why the Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue for CMS Energy (CMS), Zacks,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? CMS Energy (CMS), which belongs to the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, could be a great candidate to consider.This energy company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11.06%.For the last reported quarter, CMS Energy came out with earnings of $0.77 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.68 per share, representing a surprise of 13.24%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.45 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.49 per share, delivering a surprise of 8.89%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for CMS Energy lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.CMS Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.82%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on February 4, 2021.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

3301,FOXA,Dec-03-20,11:30AM,Why Is Fox (FOXA) Up 19.4% Since Last Earnings Report?, Zacks,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Fox (FOXA). Shares have added about 19.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Fox due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Fox Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Rise Y/YFox Corporation reported first-quarter fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings of $1.18 per share that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 45.7% and increased 42.25 year over year.Revenues were up 1.9% year over year to $2.71 billion. The figure surpassed the consensus mark by 5.1%.Affiliate fees (56.4% of revenues) rose 10% to $1.53 billion while Advertising (35.7% of revenues) revenues declined 6.9% to $969 million. Other revenues (7.7% of revenues) declined 7.3% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $215 million.Fox became a standalone, publicly-traded company on Mar 21, 2019, following the merger of Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.The standalone Fox’s portfolio comprises Twenty-First Century Fox’s news, sports and broadcast businesses. These include FOX News, FOX Business, FOX Broadcasting Company (the FOX Network), FOX Sports, FOX Television Stations Group, sports cable networks like FS1, FS2, FOX Deportes and Big Ten Network as well as certain other assets.Top-Line DetailsCable Network Programming (48.8% of revenues) revenues improved 3.1% year over year to $1.32 billion. Revenues from Affiliate fees increased 3.6% year over year, as contractual price increases, including the impact of distribution agreement renewals, were partially offset by net subscriber declines.Advertising revenues moved up 17.7% year over year, primarily attributed to higher pricing and stronger ratings at FOX News Media were partially offset by the postponement of live events at FS1 as a result of COVID-19.Other revenues declined 42.4% on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to lower sports sublicensing revenues as a result of COVID-19.Television (49.7% of revenues) revenues declined marginally by 0.4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure to $1.35 billion. Advertising revenues declined 14.9% year over year primarily due to fewer NFL broadcasts compared to the prior year, the postponement of college football games at FOX Sports and certain scripted programming at FOX Entertainment as a result of COVID-19 and the absence of the prior-year broadcast of the 71st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards.Meanwhile, Affiliate fees and other revenues increased 23.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Affiliate revenues were driven by increases in fees from third-party FOX affiliates and higher average rates per subscriber, partially offset by net subscriber declines, at the company’s owned and operated television stations.Story continuesOperating DetailsIn first-quarter fiscal 2021, operating expenses fell 20.4% year over year to $1.16 billion. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted on a year-over-year basis to 43% from 55% in the year-ago quarter.Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 10.2% on a year-over-year basis to $388 million. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses expanded 110 bps to 14.3%.The year-over-year increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher costs related to FOX operating as a standalone public company.Segment EBITDA increased 36.2% year over year to $1.16 billion. EBITDA margin expanded on a year-over-year basis to 42.9% from 32.1% in the year-ago quarter.Cable Network Programming EBITDA improved 14.2% to $781 million. EBITDA margin grew 570 basis points (bps) to 58.9%.Television EBITDA jumped 82.1% to $457 million. EBITDA margin expanded on a year-over-year basis to 33.9% from 18.5% in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetAs of Sep 30, 2020, Fox had $5.06 billion in cash and cash equivalents compared with $4.64 billion as of Jun 30, 2020.Long-term debt as of Sep 30, 2020 was $7.94 billion, which remained flat sequentially.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review. The consensus estimate has shifted 31.64% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Fox has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of this revision looks promising. It comes with little surprise Fox has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The energy index tumbled over 3%.The S&P 500 gave up earlier gains of almost 1%. The index has surged about 13% to record highs in 2020, despite the pandemic, which has wrought economic devastation and killed more than a million people.""While the entire market is pleased, is optimistic, is bullish about the arrival of the vaccine this morning into the U.S., I think the average investor is realizing that this roll-out, this distribution of the vaccine is not going to be a silver bullet, is not going to go as fast as one hopes,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc was among the top boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, surging about 30% to a 4-1/2 year high after British drugmaker AstraZeneca said it would buy the U.S. biotech firm.

A-3, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Mar 11, 2020 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl. A-4, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on Mar 11, 2020 Affirmed Aaa (sf)Cl.

X-A*, Affirmed Aa1 (sf); previously on Mar 11, 2020 Affirmed Aa1 (sf)Cl. X-B*, Affirmed Aa3 (sf); previously on Mar 11, 2020 Affirmed Aa3 (sf)* Reflects interest-only classes** Reflects exchangeable classRATINGS RATIONALEThe ratings on six P&I classes were affirmed due to the credit support and because the transaction's key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable ranges.The rating on Cl. C was downgraded due to decline in pool performance and higher anticipated losses as a result of the increased share of specially serviced loans. The six specially serviced loans are secured by retail and hotel properties and in total make up 12% of the pool. The largest specially serviced loan, Queen Ka'ahumanu Center (8% of the pool), is secured by a regional mall which had experienced declining performance prior to 2020 and was 60 days delinquent as of the January remittance date.Story continuesThe ratings on the IO classes were affirmed based on the credit quality of the referenced classes.The rating on class PEZ was affirmed due to the credit quality of the referenced exchangeable classes.The coronavirus outbreak, the government measures put in place to contain it, and the weak global economic outlook continue to disrupt economies and credit markets across sectors and regions. Our analysis has considered the effect on the performance of commercial real estate from the current weak US economic activity and a gradual recovery for the coming months. Although an economic recovery is underway, it is tenuous and its continuation will be closely tied to containment of the virus. As a result, the degree of uncertainty around our forecasts is unusually high. Stress on commercial real estate properties will be most directly stemming from declines in hotel occupancies (particularly related to conference or other group attendance) and declines in foot traffic and sales for non-essential items at retail properties.We regard the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under our ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety.Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 11.8% of the current pooled balance, compared to 7.9% at Moody's last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is now 10.5% of the original pooled balance, compared to 7.3% at the last review. Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTIONThe principal methodology used in rating all classes except exchangeable classes and interest-only classes was ""Approach to Rating US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS"" published in September 2020 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1244778. The principal methodology used in rating exchangeable classes was ""Moody's Approach to Rating Repackaged Securities"" published in June 2020 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1230078.

Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.DEAL PERFORMANCEAs of the January 12, 2021 distribution date, the transaction's aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 14% to $1.07 billion from $1.26 billion at securitization. The certificates are collateralized by 81 mortgage loans ranging in size from less than 1% to 8% of the pool, with the top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 46% of the pool. Eleven loans, constituting 10% of the pool, have defeased and are secured by US government securities.Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 27, compared to a Herf of 30 at Moody's last review.As of the January 2021 remittance report, loans representing 80% were current or within their grace period on their debt service payments, 8% were beyond their grace period but less than 30 days delinquent, 8% were between 30 -- 59 days delinquent and 3% were 90+ days delinquent.Fifteen loans, constituting 28% of the pool, are on the master servicer's watchlist, of which three loans, representing 10% of the pool, indicate the borrower has requested relief or received loan modifications in relation to coronavirus impact on the property. The watchlist includes loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance.Two loans have been liquidated from the pool, resulting in an aggregate realized loss of $4.7 million (for an average loss severity of 15%). Six loans, constituting 12% of the pool, are currently in special servicing. Five of the specially serviced loans, representing 11% of the pool, have transferred to special servicing since April 2020.The largest specially serviced loan is the Queen Ka'ahumanu Center Loan ($86.8 million -- 8.1% of the pool), which is secured by the borrowers' fee simple interest in a 507,904 square foot (SF) regional mall located on the island of Maui in Kahului, Hawaii. The mall features an open-air design and is the only regional mall in Maui. The property is anchored by two Macy's stores (82,950 SF and 80,080 SF) with lease expiration in 2024 and a Sears (77,580 SF) with a lease expiration in October 2023. Junior anchors include a Foodland Grocery Store and a 6-screen Ka'ahumanu Theatre, which had temporarily closed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. As of March 2020, the property was 89% leased compared to 90% leased in December 2019. As of year-end 2019 in-line occupancy was 80%. The property's net operating income (NOI) had been falling since year-end 2016 due to declining rental revenue and increased expenses. The year-end 2019 NOI was 44% lower than in 2016 and the 2019 DSCR (NOI) was 0.96X. The declining performance accelerated in 2020 with a NOI DSCR in March 2020 of 0.84X. The loan was originally structured with a five-year interest-only period that ended in October 2019 and has since amortized 1.9% from securitization. The loan transferred to special servicing in June 2020 after the property's cash flow had been further impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The borrower was previously funding debt service shortfalls through portions of 2020, however, as of the January 2021 remittance date the loan was last paid through its October 2020 payment date. The special servicer is currently dual tracking the foreclosure process along with a potential loan modifications.The second largest specially serviced loan is the Hilton Garden Inn Cleveland Airport Loan ($13.1 million -- 1.2% of the pool), which is secured by a 7-story, 168-key full-service hotel located in Cleveland, OH approximately 1-mile North of Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport and 10-miles SW of Cleveland CBD. The property operates under a franchise agreement with Hilton expiring in 2034. The loan benefits from amortization and has amortized nearly 10% since securitization. The property had performed well prior to 2020 with increasing revenue and had a 2.57X NOI DSCR for the trailing-twelve-month period ending September 2019. However, the property's cash flow was significantly impacted by the pandemic and the loan transferred to special servicing in June 2020. As of the January 2021 remittance statement the loan was last paid through March 2020 and the special servicer is currently in the process of setting up cash management while dual tracking the foreclosure process and discussing workout alternatives.The third largest specially serviced loan is the Staybridge Suites Lafayette Loan ($12.4 million -- 1.2% of the pool), which is secured by a 118-key extended-stay hotel located in Lafayette, Louisiana. The loan transferred to special servicing in December 2017 and subsequently became REO in March 2019. Property performance had already declined due to significant exposure to the oil and gas industry. According to the special servicer, the property is under contract for sale and scheduled for closing in February 2021.The remaining three specially serviced loans are secured by limited service hotel properties and each represent less than 1% of the pool. Moody's estimates an aggregate $72.1 million loss for the specially serviced loans (59% expected loss on average).As of the January 2021 remittance statement cumulative interest shortfalls were $1.5 million. Moody's anticipates interest shortfalls will continue because of the exposure to specially serviced loans and/or modified loans. Interest shortfalls are caused by special servicing fees, including workout and liquidation fees, appraisal entitlement reductions (ASERs), loan modifications and extraordinary trust expenses.The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's loan-to-value ratio, referred to as the Moody's LTV or MLTV. As described in the CMBS methodology used to rate this transaction, we make various adjustments to the MLTV. We adjust the MLTV for each loan using a value that reflects capitalization (cap) rates that are between our sustainable cap rates and market cap rates. We also use an adjusted loan balance that reflects each loan's amortization profile. The MLTV reported in this publication reflects the MLTV before the adjustments described in the methodology.Moody's received full year 2019 operating results for 100% of the pool, and partial year 2020 operating results for 94% of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 112%, compared to 108% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 21% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.6%.Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.50X and 0.97X, respectively, compared to 1.55X and 1.00X at the last review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan balance.The top three conduit loans represent 21% of the pool balance. The largest loan is the 1201 North Market Street Loan ($81.0 million -- 7.5% of the pool), which is secured by a 23-story, Class A office building containing 447,440 SF of net rentable area, located in Wilmington, Delaware. The building contains a 32,800 SF component that operates as a Tier III data co-location center, which provides high speed data connections to area networks and providers. As of the September 2020 annualized financials, revenues at the property had declined 10% when compared to 2018 while occupancy and expenses have remained relatively stable. As of September 2020, the property was 79% leased, unchanged from December 2019 and down from 81% as of December 2018. The September 2020 year-to-date actual NOI DSCR dropped to 1.30X from 1.35X in December 2019 and 1.43X in December 2018. The loan began amortizing in November 2017 after a three-year interest-only period and has since amortized 5.2%. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 133% and 0.77X, respectively, compared to 120% and 0.85X at the last review.The second largest loan is the 5599 San Felipe Loan ($78.5 million -- 7.3% of the pool), a 20-story, Class A office building located in Houston, Texas. The property includes an eight-level parking garage, an on-site deli and panoramic views of downtown Houston and the Galleria district. The property's cash flow has been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and the annualized September 2020 NOI at the property declined 30% when compared to the year ending December 2019, primarily driven by a decline in rental revenues. As of September 2020, the property was 92% leased, compared to 99% as of December 2019. Schlumberger Ltd, an oilfield services company, is the property's largest tenant, occupying 72% of the NRA with a lease expiration in July 2027. Moody's value takes into account declining performance of the property and the significant single tenant exposure. The loan began amortizing in November 2019 after a five-year interest-only period and has since amortized 1.9%. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 153% and 0.72X, respectively, compared to 130% and 0.89X at the last review.The third largest loan is the Twin Cities Premium Outlets Loan ($65.0 million -- 6.1% of the pool), which represents a pari passu interest in a $115.0 million senior mortgage loan. The loan is secured by a 409,207 SF open-air outlet shopping center located in Eagan, MN, approximately 10 miles south of downtown Minneapolis and 5 miles south of Mall of America. The borrowing entity is a joint venture between affiliates of Paragon Outlets (an affiliate of The Lightstone Group) and Simon Property Group, L.P. The property was constructed in 2014 and major tenants at the property include Saks Off Fifth (6.8% of NRA), Nike (4.2%), Polo (3.7%), Old Navy (3.0%), Under Armour (2.9%) and Gap (2.8%). As of September 2020, the property was 88% leased compared to 93% in 2019 and 96% in 2018. There is minimal lease rollover over the next twelve months, however, approximately 53% of the NRA is due to expire in 2024. The trailing-twelve-month sales at the property as of June 2020 were $429 PSF compared to $485 PSF as of June 2019. The year-end 2019 NOI was up 17% as compared to securitization due to higher revenues, however the property's cash flows have since been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The property closed temporarily in March 2020 due to the pandemic but reopened in May 2020. Although property performance declined through June 2020, the June 2020 NOI DSCR was 2.51X compared to 2.93X in 2019. The loan is interest only for its entire term and has remained current. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 105% and 1.00X, respectively, compared to 97% and 1.09X at the last review.REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form.

""Our focus on operational execution and efficiency allowed us to match the highest full-year adjusted operating EBITDA margin we have ever achieved at 28.4%.(a) So, in a year where many companies suffered significant financial impacts from the pandemic and resulting economic crisis, Waste Management delivered full-year 2020 results within 1.5% of our record-high 2019 adjusted operating EBITDA.(a)Story continues""Complementing our strong financial performance is the recognition that we continue to receive for leading the way to a more sustainable future. Fortune magazine recently named Waste Management to its 2021 World’s Most Admired Companies List, and for the fifth consecutive year, CDP included Waste Management on its ‘A List’ for climate leadership. We remain committed not only to managing waste responsibly but also investing in recycling infrastructure and renewable energy projects and collaborating with our stakeholders to create new, sustainable environmental solutions.""KEY HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND THE FULL YEAR 2020RevenueIn the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue increased $185 million in the Company’s collection and disposal business compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by $202 million in acquisition revenue and $79 million of growth from yield partially offset by $93 million in volume declines. For the full year, revenue decreased $141 million in the Company’s collection and disposal business compared to 2019, primarily driven by $669 million in volume declines partially offset by $299 million of growth from yield and $244 million in acquisition revenue.Core price for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 3.2% compared to 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, core price was 2.9% for 2020 compared to 4.2% in 2019.(d)Collection and disposal yield was 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 3.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, collection and disposal yield was 2.2% in 2020 compared to 2.8% in 2019.The Company’s 2020 pricing results were muted relative to historical results due to deliberate customer-centric steps taken during the second quarter to temporarily suspend price increases and certain fees for customers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company remains firmly committed to its pricing programs as evidenced by the Company’s strong post-collection and residential yield.Total Company volumes declined 2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a decline of 5.1% in the third quarter of 2020 and a decline of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, total Company volumes declined 4.5% in 2020 compared to growth of 2.3% in 2019.Cost ManagementTotal Company operating expenses were 61.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 60.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an unfavorable comparison for alternative fuel tax credits of 150 basis points. For the full year, total Company operating expenses were 61.4% of revenue in both 2020 and 2019.SG&A expenses were 12.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were 10.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 10.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, SG&A expenses were 11.4% of revenue in 2020 compared to 10.6% in 2019. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were 10.2% of revenue in 2020 compared to 10.3% in 2019.(a)The recently-closed Advanced Disposal acquisition increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2020 and had an immaterial impact on adjusted SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020.ProfitabilityTotal Company operating EBITDA was $1.09 billion, or 26.8% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $1.05 billion, or 27.3% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, total Company operating EBITDA was $1.14 billion, or 28.1% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to adjusted operating EBITDA of $1.12 billion, or 29.1% of revenue, for the same period in 2019.(a) The margin decreases were driven by an unfavorable comparison for alternative fuel tax credits of 150 basis points.For the full year, total Company operating EBITDA was $4.11 billion, or 27.0% of revenue, for 2020 compared to $4.28 billion, or 27.7% of revenue, for 2019. On an adjusted basis, total Company operating EBITDA was $4.32 billion for 2020 compared to adjusted operating EBITDA of $4.38 billion for 2019. Adjusted operating EBITDA was 28.4% of revenue in both years, demonstrating the Company’s strong focus on controlling costs in the lower volume environment.(a)The recently-closed Advanced Disposal acquisition had a negative 50 basis point impact on adjusted operating EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020.In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company realized between $10 and $15 million of annualized run-rate synergies from the acquisition of Advanced Disposal.Free Cash Flow & Capital AllocationIn the fourth quarter of 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $753 million compared to $1.02 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.40 billion in 2020 compared to $3.87 billion in 2019. The year-over-year comparisons were impacted by an increase in cash taxes, which was due in large part to the tax gain realized on the sale of assets and businesses to GFL Environmental.During the second and third quarters of 2020, the Company deferred payment of payroll taxes as provided for by the CARES Act. In light of the Company's strong financial performance and operating cash flow, management elected to pay the previously deferred 2020 payroll taxes in the fourth quarter. While there is no impact of this decision on the comparison of 2020 and 2019 cash flow from operations, this decision decreased fourth quarter and full year 2020 cash flow by approximately $120 million from prior outlook.In the fourth quarter of 2020, capital expenditures were $394 million compared to $286 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, capital expenditures were $1.63 billion in 2020 compared to $1.82 billion in 2019 as the Company took prudent steps to reduce and defer certain aspects of capital spending.In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company closed on the sale to GFL Environmental of the assets required to be divested by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with the Advanced Disposal acquisition. Proceeds from divestures were $865 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, with $856 million of this related to the divestitures to GFL Environmental. For the full year, proceeds from divestures were $885 million in 2020 compared to $49 million in 2019.In the fourth quarter of 2020, free cash flow was $1.22 billion compared to $756 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, free cash flow was $2.66 billion in 2020 compared to $2.11 billion in 2019.(a)During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company paid $231 million of dividends to shareholders.2021 OUTLOOKRevenue GrowthTotal Company revenue growth is expected to be between 10.75% and 11.25%. Combined internal revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business is expected to be between 4% and 4.5%, primarily driven by the Company’s disciplined pricing programs which are expected to result in core price of 4.0% or greater and yield of approximately 2.5%.ProfitabilityAdjusted operating EBITDA is expected to be between $4.75 and $4.9 billion for the full year.(a)Synergies from the completed acquisition of Advanced Disposal are included in this measure and are expected to be between $50 million and $60 million in 2021.Free Cash Flow & Capital AllocationFree cash flow is projected to be between $2.25 and $2.35 billion.(a)Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.88 billion.The Company is committed to returning its leverage ratio, as defined in its revolving credit facility financial covenant, to its targeted long-term range of between 2.5 and 3-to-1 during 2021.The Board of Directors has indicated its intention to increase the dividend by $0.12 per share to $2.30 on an annual basis for an approximate annual cost of $975 million. This represents the 18th consecutive year of increases in the Company’s per share dividend. The Board of Directors must separately approve and declare each dividend.In December 2020, the Board of Directors refreshed the Company’s share repurchase authorization, allowing for the repurchase of up to $1.35 billion of the Company’s common stock, signaling confidence in the cash flow outlook.Fish concluded, ""In 2020, we quickly and successfully learned to operate our business with a lower cost structure while maintaining our focus on exceptional customer service. We also completed the acquisition of Advanced Disposal and accelerated our customer service digitalization investments, all while matching our highest adjusted operating EBITDA margin and generating strong cash flow. In 2021, we will continue to make investments in technology that transform our business and integrate the Advanced Disposal business, and we are well-positioned to generate strong returns.""(a)The information labeled ""As Adjusted"" in the table above, as well as adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating EBITDA outlook and free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Please see ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below and the reconciliations in the accompanying schedules for more information.(b)Management defines operating EBITDA as GAAP income from operations before depreciation and amortization; this measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.(c)For purposes of this press release, all references to ""Net income"" refer to the financial statement line item ""Net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.""(d)Core price is a performance metric used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of our pricing strategies; it is not derived from our financial statements and may not be comparable to measures presented by other companies. Core price is based on certain historical assumptions, which may differ from actual results, to allow for comparability between reporting periods and to reveal trends in results over time. Beginning with the fourth quarter 2019, the Company has updated its core price calculation. With advancements in technology, the Company began collecting additional transactional customer level data, which provides improved clarity of the impact of the Company’s pricing activities. While this does not change the year-over-year core price performance result, the new measure reflects a more precise calculation in the evaluation of revenue changes.The Company will host a conference call at 10 a.m. (Eastern) today to discuss the fourth quarter and full year results.

This press release contains a number of such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, all statements under the heading ""2021 Outlook"", as well as all statements regarding future performance or financial results of our business; future investments and results from investments; cost structure or efficiencies; integration of, and benefits from, the acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (""Advanced Disposal""); future leverage ratio; future share repurchases and future sustainability efforts. You should view these statements with caution. They are based on the facts and circumstances known to the Company as of the date the statements are made. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different from those set forth in such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to failure to implement our optimization, growth, and cost savings initiatives and overall business strategy; failure to identify acquisition targets and negotiate attractive terms; failure to consummate or integrate acquisitions; failure to obtain the results anticipated from acquisitions; failure to successfully integrate the acquisition of Advanced Disposal, realize anticipated synergies or obtain the results anticipated from such acquisition; environmental and other regulations, including developments related to emerging contaminants, gas emissions and renewable fuel; significant environmental, safety or other incidents resulting in liabilities or brand damage; failure to obtain and maintain necessary permits; failure to attract, hire and retain key team members and a high quality workforce; labor disruptions and wage-related regulations; significant storms and destructive events influenced by climate change; public health risk and other impacts of COVID-19 or similar pandemic conditions, including increased costs, social and commercial disruption and service reductions; increased competition; pricing actions; commodity price fluctuations; international trade restrictions; disposal alternatives and waste diversion; declining waste volumes; weakness in general economic conditions and capital markets; adoption of new tax legislation; fuel shortages; failure to develop and protect new technology; failure of technology to perform as expected, including implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system; failure to prevent, detect and address cybersecurity incidents or comply with privacy regulations; negative outcomes of litigation or governmental proceedings; and decisions or developments that result in impairment charges. Please also see the Company’s filings with the SEC, including Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated by our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to its business. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, including financial estimates and forecasts, whether as a result of future events, circumstances or developments or otherwise.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTo supplement its financial information, the Company has presented, and/or may discuss on the conference call, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted income from operations, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating EBITDA, adjusted operating EBITDA margin, and free cash flow, as well as projections of adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow for 2021. All of these items are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with (i) financial measures the Company uses in the management of its business and (ii) additional, meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods’ results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance and are not representative or indicative of its results of operations.In addition, the Company’s projected full year 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA is anticipated to exclude the effects of other events or circumstances in 2021 that are not representative or indicative of the Company’s results of operations. Such excluded items are not currently determinable, but may be significant, such as asset impairments and one-time items, charges, gains or losses from divestitures or litigation, and other items. Due to the uncertainty of the likelihood, amount and timing of any such items, the Company does not have information available to provide a quantitative reconciliation of such projection to the comparable GAAP measure.The Company discusses free cash flow and provides a projection of free cash flow because the Company believes that it is indicative of its ability to pay its quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay its debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace ""Net cash provided by operating activities,"" which is the most comparable GAAP measure. The Company believes free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how the Company views its liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that the Company has committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets (net of cash divested); this definition may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.The quantitative reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in the accompanying schedules, with the exception of projected adjusted operating EBITDA. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP.WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(In Millions,

1488,FFIV,Jul-28-20,10:58AM,A Look Into F5 Networks's Price Over Earnings, Benzinga," Right now, F5 Networks Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIV) share price is at $140.88, after a 6.85% drop. Over the past month, the stock spiked by 1.00%, but over the past year, it actually fell by 3.98%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio.The stock is currently higher from its 52 week low by 76.59%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Software—Infrastructure stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company’s current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.View more earnings on FFIVMost often, an industry will prevail in a particular phase of a business cycle, than other industries.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 30.97 in the Software—Infrastructure industry, F5 Networks Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 26.96. Shareholders might be inclined to think that they might perform worse than its industry peers. It’s also possible that the stock is undervalued.There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings.Story continuesSee more from BenzingaRecap: F5 Networks Q3 EarningsEarnings Scheduled For July 27, 2020Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 24, 2020© 2020 Benzinga.com.

It earlier hit a session peak of $61.27.81, its highest since January 2020. WTI has risen more than 26% year-to-date.London-traded Brent, the global benchmark for crude, settled up 99 cents, or 1.6%, at $64.34, after setting a 13-month high of $64.74. Brent is up almost 25% on the year.Oil’s rally this year has been sparked and sustained by a combination of factors.It began with the November breakthrough in vaccines for the Covid-19. That was followed by OPEC leader Saudi Arabia’s announcement of deeper production cuts in January.From then, commodity-index linked buying of oil, sizable weekly drops in U.S. crude stockpiles and hopes for economic stimulus from the Biden administration spurred gains.This week, the snowstorm that blanketed the typically sweltering heart of U.S. oil country — Texas — has continued to shore up the market’s strong base.ANZ and Citigroup (NYSE:C) analysts estimated at least 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of U.S. shale oil production had been curtailed by the Texas storm.Citi estimated a cumulative production loss of around 16 million barrels through early March.Related ArticlesBiden scraps Trump plan to weaken environmental rules to build renewables in CaliforniaOil Inventories Fall by 5.8M Barrels Last Week: API'Ice everywhere' as Texans brave cold, 2.7 million homes lack power",finance.yahoo.com,-1

10742,KR,Dec-29-20,07:00AM,"Retails Boom-and-Bust 2020, in 10 Charts", Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The pandemic delivered a core-shaking shock to the consumer-goods industry, abruptly reshaping what people were buying where they were buying, and how they were buying. For some companies, it has led to deep damage that is still fully revealing itself. For others, it has created opportunity.As 2020 comes to close, it’s worth reflecting on these changes and where they have left the sector heading into 2021. Here, 10 charts tell the tale:Toilet paper on a roll. As the reality of the pandemic came into focus for consumers in mid-March, the grocery business was gripped by a wave of pantry-loading that resulted in massive spikes in sales of certain products — and eventually, empty shelves. In a single week in March, sales of liquid hand soap soared 320% from a year earlier, while purchases of frozen meat climbed 132% and sales of toilet paper surged 236%. Hand sanitizer, meanwhile, was in such demand that year-over-year sales skyrocketed more than 1,000% in each week from early May to early July. Such extraordinary jolts of buying fever scrambled the consumer products industry, with brands taking steps such as bringing on third-party manufacturing partners and dropping less popular items to focus on the production of top sellers. Although demand has retreated from the frenzy of the early days of the pandemic, sales of consumer packaged goods have still held above last year’s levels. With widespread distribution of Covid-19 vaccines months away and many people still spending a large chunk of their time at home, strong sales in this category are likely to continue.Online grocery carts fill up. Before the pandemic, grocery was something of a final frontier in e-commerce, remaining mostly untouched by retail’s digital transformation. Even though supermarkets and big-box stores were able to stay open throughout spring lockdowns, masses of shoppers decided to try online grocery shopping — include curbside pickup — for the first time or began doing more of it as a safety precaution. Some consumers will go back to their old, store-centric routine after the crisis is over, but many will stick to their new shopping habits. Years from now, this will be remembered as a tipping point for adoption, and one that significantly altered the showdown between Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Kroger Co.Story continuesBig tickets. As customers adhered to social-distancing guidelines, they packed their spending into a limited number of stock-up trips and skipped the in-between, fill-in stops. This behavior is perhaps most clearly illustrated in the results of Walmart’s U.S. business, where declines in transactions, a proxy for traffic, have been more than offset by a boom in ticket, or the average amount spent per order. Relatedly, this unusual year brought changes in conversion, or the rate at which shoppers go from browsing to buying. When consumers set foot in a store in this environment, their intent to buy something was quite strong. That’s why, for example, there was such a disparity in the decrease in foot traffic recorded over Black Friday weekend — down 42% from last year, according to RetailNext — and the drop in brick-and-mortar sales, which was only 24%.Stuff Rules. Millions of Americans lost their jobs or experienced economic hardship because of the pandemic, a dynamic that threatened to decimate retailers’ sales. That’s not how things played out, though. While some consumers have moved to the sidelines amid the economic gloom, others are redirecting the dollars they might once have spent on plane tickets, hotel stays or movie tickets toward retailers, perhaps to buy a new big-screen TV or home-gym equipment. The fact that consumers have had so few options for spending on experiences has made the retail industry’s recovery easier. The tables will likely turn when vaccines are distributed widely and pent-up demand for travel and other services is unleashed.Spending Shift. Social distancing and lockdowns rearranged our lifestyles and in doing so, rechanneled our demand. The result: sales for some products froze up and caught fire for others. It was a bleak year, of course, for purchases of dressy clothes and lipstick. But there was softness in less-obvious places, too: ConAgra Brands Inc. said demand for edible seeds declined when baseball seasons were canceled, while Mondelez International Inc. said chewing-gum sales fell as social outings dwindled. At the same time, the pandemic acted as rocket fuel for sales of a wide array of products, including frozen foods, massage appliances, Crocs, printers, mattresses, snowshoes, rice cookers, bicycles and hair masks. Among the most notable beneficiaries of stay-at-home living are the twin empires of the home-improvement business, Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos., which each pulled in more than a year’s worth of sales growth in the third quarter after having achieved similarly gangbusters growth in the previous three-month period. Commerce Department data show what a banner year it was for these types of stores as consumers created home offices or splurged on palatial patios.The Zoom phenomenon. Amid the aforementioned category-level shift in spending, some consumer brands emerged as breakout stars among investors much as Zoom Video Communications Inc. did with the surge in remote working. Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc. boomed more than 436% this year as orders piled up for its connected stationary bikes and treadmills. Etsy Inc. was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index for part of this year as shoppers thronged the site in search of face masks. (Etsy ceded the top spot to Tesla Inc. when the electric-car maker joined the index this month. ) After sinking in late March, shares of Yeti Holdings Inc. have soared, now up more than 100% year to date, as investors realized its coolers and thermoses would be in high demand as people spent more time outside. It could be a challenge for these social-distance-friendly stocks to keep investors happy in 2021 as they lap the strong results delivered in 2020 and as more widely available vaccines may yet again change consumer spending patterns.Storefront shakeout. Lockdowns and capacity restrictions at physical stores created a sales convulsion from which many chains have struggled to recover. The situation hastened the journey of already-fragile retailers J. Crew Group, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney Co. into bankruptcy in the first half of the year. That was only the beginning: Others including Sur La Table and Stein Mart liquidated stores after filing for protection from creditors. Even chains not in bankruptcy court were forced to reassess, with Nordstrom Inc., for example, announcing 16 stores would be permanently shuttered after initial lockdowns. Bankruptcies and store closings reverberate throughout the industry in varied ways. They represent an opportunity for healthier competitors to pick up market share. But closings also sprinkle malls with empty storefronts that threaten to make those centers less viable over the long haul. CoStar Group estimates that more than 11,000 store closings were announced this year through Dec. 1.Rough run for workers. The arrival of the pandemic scrambled the retail industry’s large labor force. Workers at nonessential retailers were, in many cases, furloughed or out of a job, while others suddenly found themselves on the front lines of a dangerous public-health situation. Big chains offered hazard pay and bonuses in response to the circumstances, but in some cases, the measures felt insufficiently generous considering the explosive sales growth a given retailer was enjoying or the share buybacks it was undertaking. Dollar General Corp. expects to devote $2.5 billion to share repurchases this fiscal year, a figure that, according to a Brookings Institution analysis, is 14 times what it has pledged for pandemic-related compensation. Overall, despite big hiring sprees by the likes of Kroger and Walmart, retail employment has not returned to its pre-pandemic level.Dining devastation. The pandemic has taken a toll on the restaurant industry, with a staggering 110,000 restaurants closing amid capacity restrictions and increased dining at home, according to the National Restaurant Association. The pain has not been shared equally, though. Work-from-home arrangements have been hard on the likes of Starbucks Corp., whose cafes are prolific in dense urban areas that have been empty of office workers for much of the year. Casual eateries, which rely on packed dining rooms that are either disallowed by local regulation or are simply undesirable right now, remain in a deep sales hole. That contrasts with the relatively quick recovery made by the fast-food segment since the early days of the pandemic. McDonald’s Corp., for instance, returned to comparable sales growth in the U.S. by the third quarter, helped by its drive-through windows and well-established carryout options.Paying the price. This year presented retailers with unique conditions to wield pricing power. This showed up in a number of ways. For one, upscale clothing and accessories titans Ralph Lauren Corp., Capri Holdings Inc. and Tapestry Inc. were able to pad their gross margins by keeping the lid on promotions. But the clearest examples of price insensitivity were in the grocery business, where revenue exploded for reasons more complex than that people were eating more at home. In some cases, shoppers traded up to fancier labels, likely reflecting a desire to treat themselves in a lonely time. In others, stores and brands cut back on promotions and, in some cases, raised prices amid strong demand, contributing to a year of roaring sales growth.As retailers plan their businesses for 2021, their most difficult work will be figuring out which of these new patterns are likely to last beyond the pandemic. That is an exceedingly difficult task and will likely result in some instances of bloated inventory, mismatched manufacturing capacity and frustrated consumers. At least it won’t be 2020 anymore.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

5302,RL,Dec-08-20,03:35PM,Louvet Reveals Lessons Learned by Ralph Lauren During Pandemic, WWD,"Ralph Lauren Corp. will be a fundamentally stronger company when the pandemic finally ends as the health crisis has forced the business to accelerate several initiatives that are expected to spur growth in the future.That was the message from Patrice Louvet, president and chief executive officer of Ralph Lauren, who spoke at the National Retail Federation’s Retail Leadership Series on Tuesday morning.More from WWD13 Times Celebrities Wore Gabriela Hearst’s DesignsIn a conversation with Matthew Shay, president and ceo of the NRF, Louvet speculated on what the next five years will look like and how his company will win in this new normal. “We have to come out of this stronger than we came into it,” he said. “I like the quote: ‘Never let a good crisis go to waste.’ And this has been our mind-set as we navigate through this crisis. But the fundamentals of this company are stronger than when we started at the beginning of this year.”He said there are “five key accelerators” that will drive the 53-year-old business ahead over the next half century and beyond, and allow it to offer “unique value that is distinctive and competitive.”First is to “elevate and energize the brand” and bring the next generation of consumers into the fold. He pointed to the successful launch of the brand this summer of a virtual wardrobe on Snapchat for bitmoji users. Louvet said more than 13 million people dressed their bitmojis in Ralph Lauren and over 300 million tried on the clothes — numbers that far exceeded the company’s projections.The second driver will be the continued shift toward direct-to-consumer, he continued. Although the Ralph Lauren brand was built on a wholesale model, “we want to pivot to more direct ownership of the consumer experience. That guides our focus on investment so we are able to provide a unique experience to the consumer that reflects the standards, the values and the environment we seek for the brand.”Third is enhancing the digital experience. Although brick-and-mortar stores will continue to be important, Louvet said the Ralph Lauren web site “needs to be our online flagship.” For this holiday season, the company created virtual storefronts for its stores in New York, Paris and elsewhere to encourage customers to visit remotely for their holiday shopping in a move that blends the physical and digital experience.Story continuesFourth is international expansion “with a deliberate focus on China where we have a good foothold and the brand has good traction, but it’s very early days when I compare it to our higher luxury peers.”The fifth accelerator is to “develop high potential, underrepresented categories in our business today.” Specifically, that includes home, outerwear, ath-leisure and beauty. “One of the beauties of this brand is that it’s a lifestyle brand so we’re not pigeonholed into one or two product categories. We’re actually able to play across a wide range of options. Our challenge is actually more to choose than it is to play. We can sell you a pair of socks for $10 or a watch for $10,000.”Louvet added that there is actually an “overlay” on top of all of these accelerators: “citizenship and sustainability. I am convinced that you cannot be successful long term if you do not lead in these.” He said the company is making progress and will continue to push forward with these initiatives as well.Louvet said that he expects there will be other lasting changes as a result of the pandemic. That includes an overriding emphasis on health and safety, which has “become an important dimension in the consumer shopping journey,” along with a quest for a connected retail experience that will require brands to build long-lasting attachments to their customers.In addition, consumers will be searching for a more-personalized experience. “We want to make sure we understand them better so we can serve them in a way that really meets their needs and expectations,” he said. “Our ambition is one-to-one marketing, and ultimately, every consumer has a different experience with Ralph Lauren — still grounded in the core values and execution, but really unique.”Figuring out how to best communicate the brand’s values and purpose will be important in the future, he continued. He said that at the beginning of the pandemic, the company halted all brand and product communication and shifted to “purpose-driven” messages of hope, family and optimism. “And we saw an amazing response from consumers” in terms of purchase intent, brand consideration rank, and core brand equity. “At a time when people have been rattled, I think brands have a very important role in providing inspiration and clarity on the brand’s purpose: what difference will it make beyond selling product.”Authenticity is one of the core Ralph Lauren tenets, he continued, “and we need to put our money where our mouth is in terms of purpose and values.”He said the company has also learned some lasting lessons: “focus on what matters most, resilience, agility. I think the agility point will continue to be a core muscle we will continue to build because of this ever-changing world that we operate in.”",finance.yahoo.com,1

6172,BAC,Jan-21-21,12:20PM,Powerball winner in Maryland should remember this before cashing the $730 million ticket: expert, Yahoo Finance,"The early inclination by the unnamed winner from Maryland of the historic $730 million ticket may be to take the ungodly sum of money and buy houses, cars and whatever else offers instant gratification.But most veteran money managers would be quick to argue against doing that (at least out of the gate).The reality is whoever the winner is now has a new full-time job of being an asset manager. With such responsibilities should come a desire to not only protect the nest egg won from the lottery, but position the cash to grow as to support future generations of one’s family and any charitable givings. The most logical way to make that happen, pros would say, is to put the money into the stock market, especially the current one that is enjoying renewed bullish momentum.“People try to insist on answering the question do you fully invest or ride it out, or do you wait for more reasonable valuations? We would create another path. We have what we call a behavioral portfolio that recognizes that markets are generally efficient. You want to be fully invested in a relatively conventional way,” explained Toews Asset Management CEO Phil Toews on Yahoo Finance Live, commenting on what investors with large sums of money like a Powerball winner should do right now.Added Toews, “If you could take 50% of your equities and put it into something that can dislocate or un-correlate from negative market activity, you have this built in mechanism. It could be exceedingly difficult not to invest right now. If you leave the market, you could be punished for six to 12 months. You have all the money on the sidelines that could be pouring into the stock market for the next six months.”The Maryland Powerball winner isn’t alone with having to wrestle with the high class problem of sitting on a ton of cash that needs to find returns.Given the stock market’s strong performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, gazillions of investors’ portfolios are sitting on strong gains. That is leading to a rush of new money into the market (and pushing up the prices of those already invested in stocks) as individuals seek to expand their wealth quicker than the person around the block.Story continuesSebring,Florida-USA; May 30, 2016Consider this stat to underscore the point.Bank of America said client balances in its wealth management business surged 10% in the fourth quarter to a record $3.3 trillion. Average deposits spiked 20% year-over-year. Bank America was joined by most of its peers in the fourth quarter in reporting very strong wealth management statistics amid the market’s ascent. If one isn’t in the stock market mix here, they risk seeing their cash earn next to nothing — which is effectively wealth destroying.To be sure, the data supports Toews’ view of needing to be invested in the market.The average 10-year return on the S&P 500 is nearly 12%, points out NerdWallet. That’s a little bit more than the 10% or so return on the S&P 500 dating back to 1926.Hopefully the latest Powerball winner considers these factors. After all, they will have $546 million reasons to do so, which is the cash only lump sum payment on the winning ticket.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Netflix, Inc. NFLX, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company BMY, Abbott Laboratories ABT, Starbucks Corporation SBUX and Target Corporation TGT.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Top Research Reports for Netflix, Bristol Myers and AbbottThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Netflix, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Abbott Laboratories. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here >>>Netflix pioneered the streaming business, which every media company is now scrambling to compete in. The worry among many Netflix investors has been whether the company's first-mover status in the space gives it any competitive edge against new rivals like Disney that not only has a deep library of content, but also has a fortress balance sheet.We will see how the 'streaming wars' shake out over time, but Netflix has thus far been able to hold its ground, as can be seen in the stock's recent performance (+48.7% over the past year vs. +15.9% for the S&P 500 index). In the fourth-quarter 2020, Netflix witnessed solid growth in paid-user addition rate, reflecting strong demand for content. The company is dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content.Higher number of originals is expected to aid user base growth in 2021 despite rising competition from Apple TV+, Amazon prime video, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Discovery+ and TikTok. The company plans to release at least one new original film every week in 2021. Moreover, the launch of low-priced mobile plans is expected to expand its subscriber base in Asia Pacific.Story continues(You can read the full research report on Netflix here >>>)Shares of Bristol-Myers have gained +4% in the last six months against the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry's gain of +5.1%. The Zacks analyst believes that its immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, and blood thinner drug, Eliquis, will drive growth for Bristol-Myers.Eliquis is the leading oral anticoagulant drug and the company continues to witness growth in both the Eliquis brand and the market. However, the decline in Opdivo sales is concerning. The addition of sales from Celgene's drugs has boosted growth prospects.In particular, the addition of Revlimid has strengthened the oncology portfolio and fueled the top line. The label expansion of Opdivo for first-line NSCLC should somewhat offset the decline. Approval of new drugs like Inrebic, Reblozyl, Zeposia and Onureg adds a new stream of revenues. However, concerns will rise once Revlimid loses patent protection.(You can read the full research report on Bristol-Myers here >>>)Abbott shares have gained +15% over the past three months against the Zacks Medical Products industry's rise of +10.3%. The Zacks analyst believes that the branded generics and international diabetes businesses should drive growth in the coming quarters. New product launches and acquisitions should boost sales further.The company has been witnessing improvements in testing and procedure volumes across its hospital-based businesses. At the same time, its consumer-facing businesses like diabetes care, nutrition and established pharmaceuticals (EPD), are catching up pace. In Adult Nutrition, the company reported strong double-digit growth on robust sales of Ensure and Glucerna. Diabetes Care sales were strong on solid worldwide adoption of FreeStyle Libre.In 2020, the company received U.S. approval of Freestyle Libre 2 and CE Mark for Libre 3 and Libre Sense Glucose Sport.

10626,KHC,Feb-08-21,12:32AM,Exclusive: Buyers shun major Malaysian palm oil producers after forced labour allegations, Reuters,"By Mei Mei ChuKUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Major palm oil buyers are seeking to block FGV Holdings and Sime Darby Plantations from their global supply chain after the United States banned imports from the two Malaysian producers, four sources told Reuters.U.S. food company General Mills said it has issued global 'no buy orders' for both the companies, and the sources said other buyers have also requested suppliers to reduce or exclude FGV and Sime Darby products for supplies entering not only the United States, but also Europe, Australia and Japan.FGV and Sime Darby are two of the world's biggest palm oil producers and both were banned by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) last year over the alleged use of forced labour during production.Palm oil is one of the world's cheapest and fastest growing crops, but the industry has faced scrutiny over the years with rights groups blaming producers for vast deforestation in Southeast Asia and exploitative labour practices.The caution from buyers is another blow to Malaysian palm oil, which has long had the reputation as being more sustainable compared to bigger rival Indonesia. The two countries together control nearly 85% of global production of palm oil - a ubiquitous commodity used in everything from cereal to soap.""Customers are very afraid, and very cautious... They are questioning to what extent we are sourcing from them,"" said one source whose firm supplies palm oil products to multinational consumer goods manufacturers.""Companies are fearing the risk to their own reputation if they buy from Sime Darby and FGV,"" the source added.None of the four sources wanted to be identified as they were not authorised to talk to the media.""We have instructed all of our suppliers globally to remove both Sime Darby and FGV from our supply chain; and have issued 'no buy orders' on both suppliers,"" General Mills said in an emailed statement to Reuters.Story continuesChocolate maker Hershey said its North American suppliers have removed all Sime Darby volumes in compliance with the U.S. order.Some buyers including Nestle, Unilever and Hershey had suspended FGV since 2018 after industry watchdog Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) found ""exploitative"" labour practices in the company.But not all companies have moved quickly to remove Sime Darby from their supply chain. Sime Darby is the world's biggest producer of palm oil certified as sustainable by the RSPO.Kraft Heinz, Nestle and Unilever said they were in discussions with Sime Darby about the U.S. allegation.""We are in ongoing engagement with Sime Darby in terms of the human rights grievances that were alleged against them, and additional actions Kraft Heinz will take to ensure there are no violations of human rights in our supply chain, including the potential to terminate the business relationship,"" Kraft said.Sime Darby said many of its key customers have expressed continued support and that it has engaged with independent firms to address the U.S. ban.""We believe our customers recognise our honest commitment to continuous improvement, and our credibility as the world's largest producer of RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil, accounting for about 17% of total global CSPO supply,"" Sime Darby Oils Managing Director Mohd Haris Mohd Arshad said.FGV did not respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Mei Mei Chu; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)",finance.yahoo.com,-1
1696,ARE,Jun-06-20,10:47AM,Hedge Funds Are Excited About Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (ARE), Insider Monkey,"At the end of February we announced the arrival of the first US recession since 2009 and we predicted that the market will decline by at least 20% in (Recession is Imminent: We Need A Travel Ban NOW). In these volatile markets we scrutinize hedge fund filings to get a reading on which direction each stock might be going. In this article, we will take a closer look at hedge fund sentiment towards Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE).Is Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE) the right investment to pursue these days? The best stock pickers are turning bullish. The number of long hedge fund bets went up by 8 lately. Our calculations also showed that ARE isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q1 rankings and see the video for a quick look at the top 5 stocks). ARE was in 29 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of March. There were 21 hedge funds in our database with ARE positions at the end of the previous quarter.Video: Watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.Why do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that a select group of hedge fund holdings outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 58 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 36% through May 18th. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.[caption id=""attachment_256989"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""400""]Dmitry Balyasny of Balyasny Asset ManagemnetDmitry Balyasny of Balyasny Asset Management[/caption]At Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea. For example, 2020’s unprecedented market conditions provide us with the highest number of trading opportunities in a decade. So we are checking out trades like this one as well as this tiny cannabis play. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. Our best call in 2020 was shorting the market when the S&P 500 was trading at 3150 after realizing the coronavirus pandemic’s significance before most investors. With all of this in mind we're going to view the recent hedge fund action surrounding Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE).Story continuesHow are hedge funds trading Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE)?At Q1's end, a total of 29 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of 38% from the fourth quarter of 2019. On the other hand, there were a total of 17 hedge funds with a bullish position in ARE a year ago. With hedgies' sentiment swirling, there exists an ""upper tier"" of notable hedge fund managers who were upping their holdings meaningfully (or already accumulated large positions).Is ARE A Good Stock To Buy?More specifically, Millennium Management was the largest shareholder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE), with a stake worth $29.1 million reported as of the end of September. Trailing Millennium Management was Land & Buildings Investment Management, which amassed a stake valued at $25.3 million. Adage Capital Management, Balyasny Asset Management, and Renaissance Technologies were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Land & Buildings Investment Management allocated the biggest weight to Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE), around 10.21% of its 13F portfolio. LDR Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 5.81 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to ARE.Consequently, key hedge funds have jumped into Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE) headfirst. Land & Buildings Investment Management, managed by Jonathan Litt, established the largest position in Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE). Land & Buildings Investment Management had $25.3 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Renaissance Technologies also made a $16.5 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The other funds with new positions in the stock are George McCabe's Portolan Capital Management, Kamyar Khajavi's MIK Capital, and Lawrence Raiman's LDR Capital.Let's also examine hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE) but similarly valued. We will take a look at TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE:WMB), Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), and New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (NYSE:EDU). This group of stocks' market values match ARE's market value.[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position TDG,58,3800759,-5 WMB,47,552828,7 O,25,225190,-1 EDU,42,1555475,-8 Average,43,1533563,-1.75 [/table]View table here if you experience formatting issues.As you can see these stocks had an average of 43 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $1534 million. That figure was $196 million in ARE's case. TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O) is the least popular one with only 25 bullish hedge fund positions. Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc (NYSE:ARE) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 41.4% in 2019 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 10.1 percentage points. These stocks gained 8.3% in 2020 through the end of May and surpassed the market by 13.2 percentage points. Unfortunately ARE wasn't nearly as popular as these 10 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was quite bearish); ARE investors were disappointed as the stock returned 12.2% during the second quarter and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market in 2020.[company-follow-email id=1035443][/company-follow-email]Disclosure: None.

In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.4%.Factors to NoteThe company’s life and health premiums, which have been driving its top-line growth, are likely to have increased in the third quarter, owing to the strength of policies in force and solid agent count. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.2 billion, suggesting an improvement of 4.6% from the prior-year quarter.With respect to liquidity, Globe Life’s insurance company operating cash flows are expected to have been strong. Higher premium collections and lower health claim payments are likely to have offset higher COVID-related claims.Lower interest rate and reinvestment of proceeds from dispositions at lower yield rates are likely to have hurt the company’s net investment income in the to-be-reported quarter. At the midpoint of the guidance, the company expects an average new money rate of around 3.3% to 3.4%.Furthermore, sales in the company’s distribution channels are likely to have been relatively flat or consistent in the to-be-reported quarter. However, certain distribution channels are likely to have suffered from decreased sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Additionally, the underwriting margin as a percent of premium is likely to have been lower due to higher mortality as a result of the pandemic.Administrative expenses likely have increased in the third quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.76, indicating a decline of 1.7% from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Globe Life this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.Earnings ESP: Globe Life has an Earnings ESP of -2.60%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1.72 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76.

(Nasdaq: GILD) and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nation’s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) civil rights organization, today announced that Gilead will provide a $3.2 million grant over two years to support communities disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic in the United States, particularly communities of color. Gilead will directly fund the efforts of the HRC Foundation – HRC’s educational arm – aimed at ending the HIV epidemic, as well as fund the organization’s Transgender Justice Initiative.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005393/en/This innovative initiative builds on core strengths of each organization, including Gilead’s long-standing efforts to address healthcare disparities and HRC’s leadership in advancing justice for LGBTQ+ communities for more than 40 years. It also builds on HRC’s commitment to programmatic work that actively challenges systems, laws and policies that disproportionately disadvantage LGBTQ+ people of color. Through this initiative, HRC will launch a public education campaign to change the narrative by focusing on dismantling stigma and discrimination while developing and advancing an inclusive public policy that addresses non-discrimination measures and healthcare disparities among LGBTQ+ communities.""Too often, institutional racism and anti-LGBTQ+ bias have been barriers to comprehensive HIV prevention and treatment strategies,"" said Alphonso David, President of the Human Rights Campaign. ""This grant will allow the Human Rights Campaign to work directly with community partners, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and youth serving professionals – especially those in Black and Latinx communities in the South and around the country – to increase awareness of HIV treatment and prevention options in order to reduce health disparities, and combat the discrimination and stigma that too often leads to fatal violence against transgender women of color.""Story continues""Gilead is committed to promoting social justice and racial equity for the patients and communities we serve, as well as for our own employees,"" said Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gilead Sciences. ""The grant to HRC builds on our commitment to advance equity in healthcare, particularly in Black communities and other communities of color that are disproportionately affected by HIV and other diseases.""Stigma, homophobia and transphobia, racism, and lack of access to appropriate healthcare services are barriers to comprehensive HIV prevention and care. This particularly impacts the 1 in 4 Latino gay and bisexual cisgender men and 1 in 2 Black gay and bisexual cisgender men who will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime. The funding from Gilead will enable HRC to work directly with these communities in the Southern U.S. and around the country, with partners including Us Helping Us in Washington, D.C. and Prince George’s County, Maryland; Brotherhood Incorporated in New Orleans; TruEvolution in Riverside, California; Arianna’s Center in Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico; Community Health PIER in Greenville, Mississippi; and BU Wellness Network in Indianapolis. In addition, through this work, HRC will partner with more than 30 Historically Black Colleges and Universities to supplement their efforts in providing HIV prevention education and resources to students. The funding will also support HRC’s Transgender Justice Initiative, which seeks to address the urgent needs of the transgender community, with specific attention to individuals deeply impacted by racism, sexism and transphobia.HRC will host a virtual summit on February 23 featuring Alphonso David, HRC President and Shanell McGoy, Director, Public Affairs at Gilead, as well as advocates and community-based organization leaders, to discuss the efforts to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the U.S.About Gilead SciencesGilead Sciences, Inc. is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative medicines in areas of unmet medical need.

11263,TYL,Feb-10-21,08:44AM,Should You Be Impressed By Tyler Technologies' (NYSE:TYL) Returns on Capital?, Simply Wall St.,"If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. In light of that, when we looked at Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) and its ROCE trend, we weren't exactly thrilled.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Tyler Technologies is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.087 = US$171m ÷ (US$2.5b - US$535m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2020).Therefore, Tyler Technologies has an ROCE of 8.7%. In absolute terms, that's a low return but it's around the Software industry average of 10%. View our latest analysis for Tyler Technologies roceIn the above chart we have measured Tyler Technologies' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Tyler Technologies here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Tyler Technologies doesn't inspire confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 8.7% from 25% five years ago. However it looks like Tyler Technologies might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesOn a side note, Tyler Technologies has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 21% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE.The Key TakeawayBringing it all together, while we're somewhat encouraged by Tyler Technologies' reinvestment in its own business, we're aware that returns are shrinking. Investors must think there's better things to come because the stock has knocked it out of the park, delivering a 198% gain to shareholders who have held over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.On a separate note, we've found   2 warning signs for Tyler Technologies   you'll probably want to know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

16670,EOG,Oct-10-20,08:27AM,"Dividend Investors: Don't Be Too Quick To Buy EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) For Its Upcoming Dividend", Simply Wall St.,"Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it's exciting to see EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. You will need to purchase shares before the 15th of October to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of October.EOG Resources's next dividend payment will be US$0.38 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.50 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, EOG Resources has a trailing yield of 4.0% on the current stock price of $37.56. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether EOG Resources's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether EOG Resources has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. See our latest analysis for EOG Resources Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. EOG Resources paid out a disturbingly high 218% of its profit as dividends last year, which makes us concerned there's something we don't fully understand in the business. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It distributed 46% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.It's good to see that while EOG Resources's dividends were not covered by profits, at least they are affordable from a cash perspective. Still, if the company repeatedly paid a dividend greater than its profits, we'd be concerned. Very few companies are able to sustainably pay dividends larger than their reported earnings.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Story continuesBusinesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. EOG Resources's earnings have collapsed faster than Wile E Coyote's schemes to trap the Road Runner; down a tremendous 35% a year over the past five years.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, EOG Resources has lifted its dividend by approximately 18% a year on average. That's intriguing, but the combination of growing dividends despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out a larger percentage of profits. EOG Resources is already paying out a high percentage of its income, so without earnings growth, we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.To Sum It UpIs EOG Resources worth buying for its dividend? It's never great to see earnings per share declining, especially when a company is paying out 218% of its profit as dividends, which we feel is uncomfortably high. However, the cash payout ratio was much lower - good news from a dividend perspective - which makes us wonder why there is such a mis-match between income and cashflow. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.Having said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with EOG Resources. Case in point: We've spotted 3 warning signs for EOG Resources you should be aware of.A common investment mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see. Here you can find a list of promising dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend.This article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.

FCX may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Freeport-McMoRan is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for FCX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 40 cents per share for FCX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FCX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.71% heading into earnings season.FreeportMcMoRan Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseFreeportMcMoRan Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseFreeportMcMoRan Inc. price-eps-surprise | FreeportMcMoRan Inc.

9654,JPM,Feb-03-21,02:22PM,10 Best Financial Advisory Firms To Buy Now, Insider Monkey,"In this article we discuss 10 best financial advisory firms to buy now. You can skip our discussion of the state of the wealth management industry and growth catalysts for the financial advisory stocks and go directly to 5 Best Financial Advisory Firms To Buy Now.The coronavirus crisis gave a wakeup call to millions of individuals and businesses worldwide: you cannot just wing it when it comes to financial planning and wealth management. A survey conducted by the College of Financial Planning shows that 71% of financial advisors saw a rise in clients after the pandemic. As the economic anxiety and fears of recession increase worldwide, the already massive wealth management and financial advisory industry will thrive. A Schwab survey in 2020 showed that over 52% of the surveyed Baby Boomers said that the pandemic has made them more focused on developing a clear financial plan for retirement.Growth Catalysts for Financial Advisory and Wealth Management StocksThe wealth management and financial advisory companies have a lot of room to grow, as current market trends show that just a fraction of common people are using financial advisory services. A national poll conducted by CNBC and Acorns by SurveyMonkey in October 2020 showed that 99% of the Americans leave their financial planning to their parents, spouse or someone else. Only 1% use a financial advisor. The survey questioned 2,776 adults. Nearly 40 million people have lost their jobs in the U.S. as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. With job losses rising and financial anxiety on record highs, young Americans will start using the expertise of the financial advisory firms to plan their future and invest smartly.Robo Advisors and Rewired InvestorsCurrent trends show that wealth management and financial advisory companies tend to target only the rich. A report from Deloitte shows that mass affluent customers usually represent 80% or more of the net income generated by retail banks. Affluent customers usually regard their relationship with their provider of wealth management services as very important, the report added. As a result, most financial advisory companies and banks are targeting wealthy individuals. But this trend will change in the future, as young Americans, whom Deloitte calls “re-wired” investors, are showing a great interest in wealth management. To capture this potential customer base, financial advisory firms will have to change their attitude and practices, as Generation Z, Generation Y and even Baby Boomers are skeptical of authority and old investment methods.Story continuesDeloitte also predicts and data-driven approaches, AI and machine learning will disrupt the wealth management and financial advisory sectors. A survey by Corporate Insight said that the total assets of the 11 leading robo advisors in the US jumped 65% in just one year.Challenges for the Financial Advisory IndustryThe rise in aged population presents a challenge as well an opportunity for financial advisory companies. According to U.S. Census Bureau, in less than two decades, adults will outnumber kids in the country. Financial advisory firms will benefit from the increasing number of individuals concerned for their retirement plans. But the graying of population problem is also affecting the industry. Deloitte said that 1/3 of the current workforce in the wealth management industry will retire in the next 10 years. Financial advisory companies will have to recruit and train nearly 240,000 advisors to maintain current service levels. The generational gap between advisors and customers also presents a significant challenge for the industry.10 Best Financial Advisory Firms To Buy NowAdam Gregor/Shutterstock.com With this context of the industry in mind, let's take a look at 10 best financial advisory firms to buy now.10.

15518,MS,Feb-03-21,10:49AM,"Ally Invest, other brokerages face disruptions amid 'unprecedented' trading volume", Yahoo Finance,"A number of major brokerages reported technical difficulties this week, days after high volume paralyzed the trading platforms in the midst of a WallStreetBets-fueled frenzy.Elevated interest in stock market bets, combined with turnover from unhappy customers switching platforms, triggered service problems at Ally Invest (ALLY) and brief outages at other brokerages like TD Ameritrade and Fidelity.The issues raise questions about the technical capacity of the large brokerages to handle the surge in trading interest, as meme stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) draw interest from brand new investors at unseen volumes.Volume last Wednesday reached record levels, as investors traded more than 23.6 billion shares of U.S.-listed companies, according to Bloomberg data. Activity on Monday was comparably lower at 15.9 billion shares, but still elevated compared to normal trading levels over the past few months.‘I am pulling all my money’At Ally Invest, users reported issues logging into accounts over the weekend, and those able to successfully get through saw massive discrepancies in their account balances.Fowana Terry lives in San Francisco and noticed on Saturday that her Ally Invest account was showing the wrong balance, reflecting old stock holdings from 2017. The issue was not corrected until Tuesday night.Terry, who was not trying to invest in the high-volatility tickers, told Yahoo Finance that the error was preventing her from making investments in even other stocks. Her calls over the weekend were met with assurances from Ally that they were working on it.“That’s a piece of s*** excuse especially when it’s dealing with people’s finances,” Terry said.Ally Invest told Yahoo Finance Tuesday afternoon that the platform is still experiencing some problems for a “shrinking number of customers” amid “huge spikes” in account openings, concurrent users, and transactions.“Extraordinary market volatility coupled with unprecedented volume challenged our platforms this past week, leading to login issues and other system anomalies,” said Ally Invest spokesperson Rebecca Anderson.Story continuesIn the meantime, the brokerage is offering broker-assisted trades over the phone and is working on upgrading their systems.That may have been too little, too late for Aaron Morris in Kansas, who exercised a call option on Friday to buy 100 shares Gamestop at $95 each. But the stock was not showing up in his Ally Invest account through the weekend and into Monday, when he had hoped to trade the shares.After a four and a half hour wait on Tuesday, Morris was able to reach Ally over the phone and sold the shares in a market order at $85 each, taking a loss as GameStop tumbled 60% on Tuesday.For comparison, shares of GameStop were trading as high as $322 on Monday.“As soon as this settles I am pulling all of my money from Ally,” Morris told Yahoo Finance. Screenshots provided to Yahoo Finance confirmed that the site was still incorrectly listing Morris’s holdings as of Wednesday morning.Issues at other brokeragesOther brokerages also suffered performance issues on Monday, as customers took to Twitter, DownDetector.com, and Reddit to flag problems.A spokesperson for Fidelity told Yahoo Finance that the platform was continuing to experience high levels of activity but quickly addressed “intermittent issues” that cropped up at the market open on Monday.A TD Ameritrade spokesperson also confirmed that its platforms had experienced some “slowness at login” due to high volume on Monday, but said the company had resolved the issue “within minutes.” The issues are not tied with Schwab (SCHW), which remains a separate broker-dealer as the companies integrate systems following last year’s completed merger.Users on E-Trade, a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley (MS), also flagged issues with being able to place trades. The company did not respond to a Yahoo Finance request for comment.The outages experienced this week do not appear to be related to restrictions last week imposed by the clearinghouses that help brokerages facilitate trades made by their users.Last Thursday, Apex Clearing Corporation halted transactions of GameStop, AMC, and Koss (KOSS), sidelining investors for about four hours on brokerage platforms that use the clearing firm (such as Ally Invest, Webull and SoFi).Ally Invest said Tuesday that transactions for the three stocks were open on its platform.Brian Cheung is a reporter covering the Fed, economics, and banking for Yahoo Finance.

6860,CRM,Feb-17-21,06:03PM,Julian Robertson's Biggest Trades of the 4th Quarter, GuruFocus.com,"By Margaret MoranJulian Robertson (Trades, Portfolio)'s Tiger Management recently disclosed its portfolio updates for the fourth quarter of 2020, which ended on Dec. 31.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with VNET. Click here to check it out. VNET 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VNETPeter Lynch Chart of VNETOften called the ""father of the hedge fund,"" Julian Robertson (Trades, Portfolio) founded Tiger Management in 1980, turning an initial $8 million into over $22 billion by the late 1990s. After losing 4% in 1998 and 19% in 1999 as rivals rode the dot-com bubble to its peak, he shut down the fund in 2000, and Tiger Management now only manages money from internal sources (mainly Robertson's personal wealth). Robertson's long-short strategy is based on investing in the best companies and shorting the worst companies, and he is known for ""betting the farm"" on his best ideas. Robertson also mentored a number of young hedge fund managers known as the ""Tiger Cubs,"" a group that includes Andreas Halvorsen (Trades, Portfolio), Chase Coleman (Trades, Portfolio), Philippe Laffont (Trades, Portfolio), John Griffin (Trades, Portfolio), Lee Ainslie (Trades, Portfolio) and Steve Mandel (Trades, Portfolio).Robertson's top buys for the quarter were 21Vianet Group Inc.

According to the GuruFocus Value chart, the stock is a possible value trap, as it is trading too far below its intrinsic value estimates. The company is expected to push for achieving profitability in 2022, and several analysts have sharply decreased their top-line expectations of the company for that year due to the fear that it could be too early for such a move.Story continuesJulian Robertson's Biggest Trades of the 4th QuarterThe company has a financial strength rating of 4 out of 10 and a profitability rating of 3 out of 10. The current ratio of 2.24 indicates the company can continue paying its short-term debts, though the Altman Z-Score of 1.85 shows financial stress that puts the company at risk of bankruptcy. The return on invested capital is lower than the weighted average cost of capital, meaning the company is spending more on its investments than it is earning back on them.Julian Robertson's Biggest Trades of the 4th QuarterBooking HoldingsThe guru also invested in 850 shares of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), which had a 0.43% impact on the equity portfolio.

The company reported adjusted earnings of 94 cents per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. However, the bottom line was 3.1% higher than the prior-year quarter figure.Escalating expenses and provisions were the undermining factors. However, higher revenues along with strong loan and deposit balances supported the company’s performance. Lower efficiency ratio was another positive.Including certain non-recurring items, net income available to common shareholders came in at $143.4 million or 97 cents per share compared with $101.9 million or 87 cents per share recorded in the prior-year quarter.For 2019, adjusted earnings of $3.90 per share jumped 7.3% from the prior year. Also, it outpaced the consensus estimate of $3.66. After adjustments, net income available to common shareholders came at 540.9 million or $3.47 per share compared with $410.5 million or $3.47 for 2018.Top Line Rises, Expenses Flare UpTotal revenues for the fourth quarter came in at $497.2 million, up 35.9% year over year. Further, the top line outpaced the consensus estimate of $483.9 million. Also, adjusted total revenues of $492.1 million improved 33.6% year over year.For 2019, total revenues were $2 billion, up 36.6%. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.9 billion. Further, adjusted total revenues of $2 billion increased 35.9% from prior year.Net interest income (NII) improved 34% to $399.3 million year over year. However, net interest margin shrunk 27 basis points (bps) to 3.65%.Non-interest income climbed 44.1% to $98 million, including a favorable adjustment in the fair value of private equity investments. Rise in almost all components of income drove this upside.Non-interest expenses were $266.1 million, flaring up 26.8% year over year. Notably, rise in almost all components of expenses resulted in this increase.Efficiency ratio came in at 53.44% compared with 57.34% reported in the year-earlier quarter. A decline in ratio indicates improvement in profitability.Total deposits totaled $38.4 billion, increasing 2.6% sequentially. Total loans climbed 2% from the prior quarter to $37.2 billion.Credit Quality: Mixed BagNon-performing loans were down 4.8% year over year to $101.6 million. Non-performing loan ratio came in at 0.27%, contracting 14 bps.However, total non-performing assets amounted to $137.5 million, rising 20.1% year over year. Non-performing asset ratio shrunk 7 bps to 0.37%.Also, net charge-offs rose 32.4% on a year-over-year basis to $8.8 million. Annualized net charge-off ratio was 0.10%, down 10 bps. Provision for loan losses was up significantly to $24.5 million.Capital PositionTier 1 capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 10.24% and 12.25%, respectively, compared with 10.61% and 12.37% as of Dec 31, 2018.Also, as of Dec 31, 2019, Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio (fully phased-in) was 8.94% compared with 9.92% in the year-ago quarter. Tier 1 Leverage ratio was 9.16% compared with 9.60% recorded a year ago.Capital Deployment UpdateDuring the quarter, the company repurchased $36.5 million in common stock or 1.1 million shares. Concurrent with the results, the company announced a dividend hike of 10%, bringing the quarterly amount to 33 cents per share. The increase will be effective April 2020.2020 OutlookManagement expects NII, excluding purchase accounting adjustments, to grow between 0% and 3%. Also, adjusted non-interest income is likely to rise 3-6%.Adjusted non-interest expenses are projected to increase 3-5%.Our TakeSynovus’ December-ended quarter results were not impressive. Despite certain cost-saving initiatives, the company’s investments in technology and talent, and to improve customer experience have kept expenses on the higher end. Also, escalating provisions remain a concern. However, the bank’s focus on organic growth, together with its strong capital and balance sheet position, is likely to aid top-line expansion.Story continuesSynovus Financial Corp.

11911,ED,Jan-19-21,12:30PM,Con Edison Can 'Connect' Customers With Solar Energy And Savings, PR Newswire,"Smart ConnectDER Avoids Expensive Upgrades And Supports Health & SafetyNEW YORK, Jan. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Con Edison is offering, free of charge, a device that can save upwards of $1,000 for a residential customer installing a new solar array.The Smart ConnectDER, built by ConnectDER, Con Edison's partner on the project, allows the customer to avoid the cost of upgrading the circuit breaker panel. It also eliminates the need for excessive electrical boxes on the side of the home.The Smart ConnectDER is an adapter that uses the electric meter socket as a point of interconnection for solar power. It fits on most electric meters and works for solar arrays up to 15 kilowatts – meaning nearly all residential solar projects.In addition, on homes where the meter socket is on an exterior wall, the installer does not have to enter the home to connect the solar to the home wiring. That means less contact and potential for coronavirus exposure between the installer and homeowner.""Providing ConnectDER technology is another step we are taking to make it convenient for customers to choose renewable energy,"" said Alexandra Bykov, Con Edison's project manager. ""Con Edison and our customers are leading the transition to a clean energy future, ensuring that our region will remain safe and sustainable.""""We're pleased to work with Con Edison to deliver quicker and safer solar connections for Greater New York,"" said Whit Fulton, the chief executive of ConnectDER. ""We're also generating information on how, when, and where solar on the local power grid will be producing energy, which will help Con Edison plan infrastructure investments and increase the adoption of clean power. Con Edison is stalwart in its commitment to get innovative, win-win solutions like ours to their customers.""Con Edison provided 300 Smart ConnectDERs to customers during a successful pilot program in 2019.Story continuesCon Edison then sought and received permission from the New York State Public Service Commission to make ConnectDER technology available to new residential solar customers across New York City and Westchester County.The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority chose the program for funding under its Future Grid Challenge, which encouraged companies to find ways to get more clean energy on the grid.NYSERDA will pay for 2,400 units with Con Edison paying the installation costs for those devices. Con Edison will continue the program even after customers and their contractors install those 2,400 devices.Smart ConnectDERs are simple and versatile. A solar contractor who wants to use a Smart ConnectDER for a customer's interconnection would send Con Edison a photo of the meter to confirm that the meter can accommodate the device.Using a Smart ConnectDER can reduce interconnection time by up to several hours.Customers or installers with questions can send an e-mail to ConnectDer@coned.com.Con Edison encourages its customers to consider whether solar energy is right for them. The company has helped more than 35,000 customers complete rooftop projects and connect them to the grid. Those panels have the capacity to produce more than 320 megawatts of power.As part of its Clean Energy Commitment, the company wants to make it possible for customers to buy 100 percent clean electricity by 2040. Con Edison Inc. is the second largest solar producer in North America and seventh largest in the world.About ConnectDER Inc. ConnectDER's mission is to make clean distributed resources the default source of power for the 21st century. ConnectDER's products are used by some of the largest electric power utilities and solar installers throughout the United States to simplify and accelerate the integration of distributed resources with the grid.

7618,INCY,Nov-20-20,10:03AM,Lilly/Incyte's Olumiant Gets FDA Emergency Nod for COVID-19, Zacks,"Eli Lilly & Company LLY and partner Incyte INCY announced that the FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) to their rheumatoid arthritis drug, Olumiant (baricitinib) in combination with Gilead’s GILD Veklury (remdesivir) for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection. The combination regimen also received EUA for use in pediatric patients, aged two years or older, with suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.The treatment regimen is presumably the first to receive an EUA for hospitalized COVID-19 pediatric patient as young as two years.Please note that Olumiant is not approved for treating COVID-19 in the United States in any setting. The recommended dose of Olumiant per the EUA is 4-mg once daily for 14 days or until hospital discharge.The EUA was granted based on data from the phase III study — ACTT-2 — conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study compared Olumiant plus Veklury to Veklury alone for efficacy and safety endpoints. Data from the study showed that the combination regimen reduced median recovery time by one day, which was statistically significant. Moreover, proportion of patients who progressed to ventilation or died by day 29 despite treatment were 23% for the combination regimen compared to 28% for Veklury alone. Adverse events and serious adverse events were also observed in lower proportion of patients for the combination regimen compared to Veklury alone.Lilly is conducting separate late-stage studies in Europe, Asia and Latin America to evaluate Olumiant, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, as a potential treatment for hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19.Shares of Lilly have increased 9.2% so far this year against the industry’s decrease of 1.3%.Story continuesApart from Olumiant, Lilly also received EUA for its antibody drug, bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) as a monotherapy last week. The drug is authorized for the treatment of recently diagnosed mild-to-moderate COVID-19 illness at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 or hospitalization. The approval was based on data from the BLAZE-1 study. The study is also evaluating a combination of bamlanivimab with Lilly’s another COVID-19 antibody candidate etesevimab in COVID-19 patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory (non-hospitalized) setting. Lilly is also evaluating bamlanivimab for the prevention (prophylaxis) of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities in a late-stage BLAZE-2 study.With rising number of coronavirus cases as well as hospitalized patients in the United States and two authorized drugs for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, Lilly’s revenues might get a boost in the upcoming quarters.We note that Pfizer (PFE) and its partner BioNTech reported 95% efficacy rate for their coronavirus vaccine candidate and may file for an EUA within few days. A few other companies may receive EUA for their vaccine candidate by year-end. While successful development of vaccine can help stop the spread of the infection, development of therapeutic antibodies or antiviral drugs will help treating infected patients. Several pharma/biotech companies are engaged in bringing a treatment/vaccine for COVID-19. Successful development of these candidates are likely to help in faster recovery of the U.S. economy as lower infection rates will help removal of restrictions.Eli Lilly and Company PriceEli Lilly and Company PriceEli Lilly and Company price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteZacks RankLilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

9212,JBHT,Dec-22-20,04:30PM,Is JBHT A Good Stock To Buy According To Hedge Funds?, Insider Monkey,"The financial regulations require hedge funds and wealthy investors that exceeded the $100 million equity holdings threshold to file a report that shows their positions at the end of every quarter. Even though it isn't the intention, these filings to a certain extent level the playing field for ordinary investors. The latest round of 13F filings disclosed the funds' positions on September 30th, about a month before the elections. We at Insider Monkey have made an extensive database of more than 817 of those established hedge funds and famous value investors' filings.

Our research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 66 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that'll significantly underperform the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 17th. That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.Story continuesAndrew Sandler of Sandler Capital ManagementAt Insider Monkey we leave no stone unturned when looking for the next great investment idea.

5606,O,Dec-09-20,08:01AM,Is Realty Income's (O) 109th Monthly Dividend Hike Sustainable?, Zacks,"Realty Income Corporation O recently announced the 109th common stock monthly dividend hike since the company’s NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 23.45 cents per share compared with the 23.40 cents paid earlier.The increased dividend will be paid on Jan 15, to shareholders on record as of Jan 4, 2021. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.814 per share versus the prior rate of $2.808 per share. Based on the company’s share price of $60.40 on Dec 8, it results in a dividend yield of 4.66%.Solid dividend payouts are the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholder wealth. Remarkably, this retail REIT enjoys a trademark of the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company”.The latest hike comes by a marginal figure from the prior dividend paid but the January dividend payments marks the company’s 606 consecutive monthly dividend payments throughout its 51-year operating history. Moreover, the company has made 93 consecutive quarterly dividend hikes, which is encouraging. The retail REIT has witnessed compound average annual dividend growth of 4.4% since its listing on the NYSE.The latest hike reflects Realty Income’s ability to generate decent cash-flow growth through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio. With a current cash-flow growth rate of 12.23%, higher than the industry’s average of 0.37%, the increased dividend is likely to be sustainable.Recently, Realty Income reported an increase in contractual rent collections across its portfolio for November, relative to the October and September receipts. As of Nov 30, contractual rent receipts across the REIT’s total portfolio improved to 93.6% for November from October’s 93.3% and September’s 93.2%. Rent collections from its investment-grade rated tenants, which account for 49% of the annualized rental revenues, were 99.9% for November, same as October’s, while it was 100% for September.Realty Income’s top four industries (reflecting around 37.4% of the annualized rent in November), convenience stores (accounting for 12.2% rental revenues), grocery stores (9.2%), drug stores (8.3%) and dollar stores (7.7%) sell essential goods and continue to thrive even amid the pandemic. The company received 100% of rent due from tenants in these industries for November.Nonetheless, businesses of physical stores widely depend on customer traffic but consumers are avoiding crowded public spaces due to the pandemic and increasingly opting for online purchases. This, in turn, is taking a huge toll on tenants’ liquidity, thereby making it difficult to meet their rental obligations. As a result, retail REITs, which have already been battling against store closures and bankruptcy issues, are feeling the heat. In fact, apart from Realty Income, this turbulence is affecting other retail REITs, including Macerich MAC, Simon Property SPG and Kimco KIM among others.For Realty Income too, the company’s tenants from theater (represented 5.7% of total portfolio annualized base rent as of Nov 30, 2020) as well as health and fitness (7%) categories have been affected by the government-mandated closures and the social-distancing wave. As of Dec 2, 2020, percentage of annualized rent for closed locations comprised 60% for theaters tenants, and 18% for health and fitness tenants. As a result, only 12% of theater rent was collected for November. Rent collections in the health and fitness category were 86% for the month.Nevertheless, Realty Income emerged as a company with decent financial health through its efforts to boost balance-sheet strength despite such a crisis. As of Sep 30, total liquidity amounted to $3.2 billion, including $724.8 million of cash in hand and $2.4 billion remaining borrowing capacity available on its $3-billion revolving credit facility, thereby enjoying healthy financial flexibility. The company also ended the third quarter with low leverage and strong coverage metrics. Further, Realty Income has a credit rating of A- and A3 from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively, enabling it to procure debt financing at attractive costs.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have depreciated 2.8% over the past six months as against the industry’s rally of 9.4%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla, Inc. TSLA, FedEx Corporation FDX, General Motors Company GM, Deere & Company DE and Lennar Corporation LEN.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Top 5 Growth Picks on Expectations of Higher Fiscal StimulusWall Street closed higher on Tuesday, a day before President elect Joe Biden formally takes charge as the next U.S. President. Last week was a disappointing one as the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — posted their worst weekly performance since the week ended Oct 30.Investors' confidence was boosted by positive signals for higher fiscal stimulus and a faster nationwide vaccination process. Meanwhile, Wall Street is maintaining its northbound journey after finishing an impressive 2020 defying the pandemic.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in growth stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank. Notably, growth investors are primarily focused on stocks with aggressive earnings or revenue growth, which should propel their stock price higher in the future. Higher fiscal stimulus and vaccination processes are likely to drive the overall growth of the economy.Expectations for Higher Fiscal StimulusOn Jan 19, during her Senate confirmation hearing, Janet Yellen, President-elect Joe Biden's designated nominee for Treasury Secretary and a former chairperson of the Federal Reserve, said that with interest rates at historic lows, the best way to counter the coronavirus-led economic devastations is to inject a big relief package although that will increase the U.S. debt burden.On Jan 14, President elect Joe Biden proposed a  new $1.9 trillion coronavirus-aid package called ""American Rescue Plan."" The proposed plan will include increasing direct payments to $2,000 from the existing $600 and supplemental unemployment benefits to $400 per week through September. The proposal also mentions that the minimum wage rate would be hiked to $15 per hour and moratoriums on eviction and foreclosure on mortgages would be extended to Sep 30.Story continuesThe plan will include $20 billion for a national vaccination program, $50 billion for COVID testing, and $350 billion aid to state and local governments. In addition, the plan will provide $130 billion for reopening of schools, $35 billion for higher education and $5 billion for a ""Hardest Hit Education Fund.""Faster Vaccination ProcessOn Jan 19, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, Biden's nominee to Head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, expressed her confidence that the country has enough COVID-19 vaccine doses to meet the Trump administration's goal of immunizing 100 million people in 100 days despite a slower-than-expected rollout.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed down our search to five large-cap (market capital > $10 billion) stocks as these companies have an established business model and a solid brand value.These stocks have strong growth potential for 2021 and witnessed robust earnings estimate revisions in the last 7 to 30 days.

Increasing demand for both Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) and specialty pharmacy is a steady key driver. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past three months, shares of CVS Health have outperformed its industry. The stock has improved 20.3% compared with 18.1% rise of the industry.CVS Health ended the third quarter of 2020 on a promising note with both earnings and revenues surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Particularly, Retail/LTC revenue rise was primarily driven by increased prescription volume and higher front store revenues. The Health Care Benefits arm benefited from strong Medicare AEP (Annual Enrollment Period) driven by CVS Health’s leading position in zero premium plans, expanded geographic footprint and continued acceleration of dual D-SNP offerings.Moreover, while Pharmacy Services revenues declined year over year, this segment delivered double-digit operating income growth, reflecting strength in specialty pharmacy along with favorable purchasing economics. The 2021 selling season too is wrapping up well with $3.3 billion of net new business. Increased guidance amid the pandemic scenario is a positive.CVS Health Corporation PriceCVS Health Corporation PriceCVS Health Corporation price | CVS Health Corporation QuoteCVS Health’s specialty digital solutions for patients witnessed 25% CAGR over the last two years, and since the start of the pandemic the company has seen over 40% of all specialty orders being placed digitally.

10276,CI,Nov-10-20,12:35PM,5 Leading Healthcare Stocks Surging On Pent-Up Demand, Insider Monkey,"IntroductionAs Mr. Valuation, I find myself constantly reminding investors that value investing requires patience. However, value investing also requires the willingness to get your money in front of attractive valuation when it is discovered. Trying to time your purchases perfectly can just as easily cause you to miss out on significant gains as it is to participate in them. More directly stated, significant undervaluation can stimulate strong pent-up demand causing stock prices to rise rapidly. Therefore, if you are not already in front of those advances, you can miss out on a lot of profit and opportunity.Furthermore, it is also common that the most attractive valuations can be found in a specific out-of-favor industry. Healthcare is one example of a sector that has been out-of-favor primarily predicated on healthcare reform risk based on politics. Consequently, the recent election results (or lack thereof) have been very favorable to healthcare in general and several subsectors more specifically. The reason is simple, the threat of significant healthcare reform has become much less likely because it appears that the GOP will retain a majority in the Senate resulting in diminishing the Democrats’ power to revamp US healthcare.It was this threat of healthcare reform that have caused several high-quality healthcare companies primarily in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, managed-care, and healthcare services to be out-of-favor and therefore undervalued despite the fact that their fundamentals remain strong. As a result, several high-quality companies in these subsectors posted strong price advances on Wednesday, November 4. Below are a Portfolio Review representing 5 high-quality examples that I am currently long on with low P/E ratios and high earnings yields:Five Leading Healthcare Stocks In Order Of Lowest To Highest P/E RatiosHealthcare StocksQ3 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and moreHere is What Happens When Pent-Up Demand Meets ValueStory continuesThe following graphics are presented to illustrate important dichotomies between each of the following company’s price and true worth (fundamental) value. Additionally, I have repeated today’s earnings and price correlated graphic to contrast the price action that occurred over one trading day. But most importantly, I want to illustrate that these high-quality companies remain attractively valued even after yesterday’s price advances. Finally, the reader should note the consistency and the above-average growth that each of these companies has achieved historically. Later in the video I will elaborate more fully by showing these companies over longer timeframes.AbbVie Inc. (ABBV): up $6.54 +7.43%AbbVie is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Even though AbbVie’s stock price rose over 7% yesterday, as you can see by the comparison of today’s graph versus yesterday’s, long-term value proposition has barely changed. Although it is too early to tell, yesterday’s price reaction might be the precursor to AbbVie moving back into alignment with its earnings and cash flow justified valuations. In other words, the stock still looks very inexpensive to me. Furthermore, even though it has been a strong performer since I received it from the Abbott Labs’ spin off, I consider it an incredibly strong performer when I measure it at fair value. Once again, I will elaborate in the video later.ABBVABBVCigna Corp. (CI): up $26.82 + 14.59%Cigna Corp. had an incredible day on Wednesday, and it continues to rise today. This is a high-quality growth opportunity that I would classify as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) opportunity. Once again, despite yesterday’s more than 14% rise, I still consider the company undervalued. Since it is purely a growth situation, it would technically carry more risk than the other names I am featuring. On the other hand, the company’s A- credit rating and low level of debt mitigate some of that risk. This is a pure capital gain play that I believe still has significant room to run.CICIBristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): up $4.19 + 6.84%Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) were up almost 7% on Wednesday, yet the company remains significantly undervalued based on a surge in earnings growth expected this year and continuing in future years. It seems inexplicable to me that this A+ rated blue-chip with well-defined future growth potential coupled with an above-average dividend yield could be selling at such a low valuation. In addition to continued growth of both earnings and dividends, P/E expansion represents a significant long-term opportunity. As the graphics below clearly illustrate, even after yesterday’s strong showing, BMY is extremely undervalued.BMYBMYAnthem Inc. (ANTM): up $34.51 + 11.76%Anthem Inc. is an extremely high-quality A rated growth stock with modest debt that rose just under 12% yesterday. Prior to yesterday’s run up, the stock was slightly undervalued and has now moved to what I would call fair value territory. Nevertheless, I continue to believe this company is attractive based on its quality and fundamental strength.BMYBMYAmgen Inc. (AMGN): up $10.14 + 4.61%Finally, biotech giant Amgen represents a quintessential example of how I like to see a stock perform. The orange line on these graphs represents a valuation reference that is the midpoint of a fair valuation range. Consequently, Amgen’s stock price has crawled the line over the past several years exactly as its valuation indicated it should. On Wednesday the stock did rise more than 4.5%, but remains at its attractive valuation range.BMYBMYFAST Graphs Analyze Out Loud Video: 5 Quintessential Consistent Value StocksSummary and ConclusionsThe primary message behind this article is that value is worth waiting for, especially when a dividend is associated. Although I only highlighted a few examples that I am long on, there are numerous other examples happening in the marketplace today. A hallmark of value investing is comprised of two traits that many people find challenging to implement. The first is having the patience to wait on a stock while it is undervalued, especially if it has been undervalued for some time. However, I refer to this as “intelligent patience” which implies waiting patiently while fundamentals remain strong and advancing. This contrasts with a so-called “value trap” which I consider to be a company that has low multiples but deteriorating fundamentals.The second trait is being able to recognize value based on fundamentals. Stated more directly, this means trusting earnings, cash flows and dividends more than price action. This can be extremely difficult for people to accept and/or implement when markets are volatile. And this trait is even more challenging to accept when a stock or sector is out-of-favor during a bull market like we are in today. Two good examples would be healthcare and financials in contrast to tech stocks. This is what I refer to as a bifurcated market. On one hand we have stocks trading at nosebleed valuations and on the other hand bargain-basement valuations. It is hard to buy value when the markets and momentum stocks are surging. Nevertheless, in the long run it will usually be the more profitable strategy.Long: CI, ABBV, BMY, AMGN, ANTM at the time of writing.",finance.yahoo.com,1
11039,TRMB,Aug-06-20,09:26AM,Trimble's Transportation Segment Reports 24% Revenue Decline, Benzinga,"Trimble Navigation Ltd. (NASDAQ: TRMB) reported second quarter transportation revenue of $150.9 million, down 24%, compared to the second quarter of 2019, during an earnings call Wednesday.Overall, the company produced $733.6 million in revenue, with an earnings per share of 52 cents, topping analysts's expectations. Wall Street's outlook was for earnings of 37 cents per share and revenue of $694.6 million.Company officials attributed the better than expected results to the strength of its ""financial model.""""Annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1.21 billion, adjusted EBITDA margins at 25.7% and deferred revenue at $531 million we're clear highlights,"" said Robert Painter, Trimble's CEO. ""Our shift to a more hardware connected, software-centric and recurring revenue business model is paying off.""Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Trimble is a provider of technology solutions for trucking companies, freight brokerages and third-party logistics providers.Painter said the company's transportation segment was impacted by the continued global economic uncertainty.""While we remain convinced of both the long term market opportunity of our supply chain strategy, as well as the viability of our strategy, we are currently performing below our potential in the transportation segment,"" Painter said.Painter added that an economic recovery ""will take longer than anticipated"" because the transportation sector has ""suppressed demand."" As such, Trimble is not providing a financial outlook for the remainder of 2020.""When I think about the macro of the end-markets we serve, specifically North America, transportation is certainly the most challenged at the moment,"" Painter said. ""There is a supply-demand imbalance, which is creating pricing pressure on the carriers.""Other factors affecting Trimble's transportation segment included its acquisition of Kuebix, as well as executing a subscription business model transition in the company's enterprise business.Story continuesPainter also said the company is working through its ELD product delivery commitments and an incentive program for customers of its mobility business to upgrade older technology.View more earnings on TRMB""The Kuebix acquisition remains strategically important, but it is currently diluted,"" Painter said. ""Kuebix takes us to the shipper market, which is key to our connected supply chain strategy.""'In February, Trimble announced it was acquiring Kuebix, a Maynard, Mass.-based TMS provider. The acquisition would enable Trimble to merge its private fleet and commercial carrier customer network of North America-based commercial trucks, with Kuebix's shipping community.A purchase price has not been disclosed.

13033,DHI,Jan-26-21,10:08AM,5 ROE Picks as Markets Brace for Earnings Season Volatility, Zacks,"The U.S. equity markets witnessed intense volatility in the past week with falling oil prices and below par quarterly performance from leading blue-chip technology stocks weighing on the indices. To add to the woes, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak continued to mount, forcing President Joe Biden to acknowledge that the country is facing an uphill task to economic recovery as fatalities are likely to increase further over the next few weeks. However, the slump was somewhat pared by solid U.S. manufacturing activity data, which surged to its highest level in more than 13.5 years in early January.    As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screen:CDW Corporation CDW: Headquartered in Vernon Hills, IL, CDW Corporation is a leading provider of integrated information technology solutions to small, medium and large business, government, education and healthcare customers in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

16683,EOG,Sep-08-20,07:00AM,RPT-FOCUS-U.S. shale producers race for federal permits ahead of presidential election, Reuters,"(Repeats to additional subscribers)By Jennifer HillerHOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Oil producers in the top U.S. shale fields are stockpiling drilling permits on federal land ahead of the November U.S. presidential election, concerned that a win by Democratic candidate Joe Biden could lead to a clamp-down on oilfield activity.Federal permitting in the largest U.S. oilfield in the Permian Basin, located in Texas and New Mexico, is up 80% in about the last three months, which analysts attribute to a hedge against a win by Biden, who currently leads U.S. President Donald Trump by several points in national polling.Biden has stated that he does not want to ban fracking outright, putting him at odds with many environmentalists and Democratic party activists.However, his climate plan includes banning new oil and gas permits on public lands, which industry groups say would hurt the economy and cut off an energy boom that has made the United States the world's largest crude oil producer.The shale revolution of recent years boosted U.S. crude output to roughly 12 million barrels per day (bpd) last year through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is environmentally controversial as it involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into rock at high pressure to release oil or natural gas.As of Aug. 24, producers have received 974 permits so far this year for new wells on federal land in the Permian, compared with 1,068 for all of last year and 265 in 2018, according to data firm Enverus.In the 90 days up till Aug. 24, producers received 404 permits in the Permian, compared with 225 and 11 in the same period in 2019 and 2018, respectively.The scramble for permits comes despite the weak outlook for oil drilling and prices due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Crude prices plunged in spring following the outbreak and have remained stuck near $40 a barrel. The number of oil and gas rigs drilling new wells in the United States hit record lows for 15 weeks and last week was 71% lower year-on-year, according to Baker Hughes data, and analysts do not expect a sharp rebound for some time.Story continuesUncertainty about a ban and other possible regulatory changes, including a proposal to modify royalties to account for climate costs, mean more permits will be filed ahead of the election, said Bernadette Johnson, vice president at Enverus.The industry has raced to file for permits before ahead of potential regulatory changes.In Colorado in 2018, as voters considered a proposition to increase the distance required between new wells and buildings, permitting jumped 165% in the last six months of the year compared with the first half, according to Enverus. At least nine producers stockpiled more than two years' worth of permits.EOG Resources Inc, Cimarex Energy Co, Matador Resources Co and Devon Energy Corp are among the shale producers who have said they expect to have years of drilling permits.Devon is ""proactively managing risks"" by stockpiling more than 550 federal permits in New Mexico and Wyoming, Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager told analysts this month.Most producers have ""a runway of 12 to 18 months"" in permits in the Permian and Wyoming's Powder River Basin, said Jake Roberts at energy investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.Federal permits are for two years and can be extended another two, but there is no guarantee that routine permit extensions would continue in the future, Cimarex CEO Tom Jorden said on an earnings call in August.U.S. oil production remains below 2019's peak and analysts expect it will be slow to recover in the coming year, as shale production depends on new investment due to the short life of the wells drilled.LAND OF ENCHANTMENTThe race for permits has centered on the part of the Permian located in New Mexico, said Artem Abramov, head of shale research at Rystad Energy.About 85% of well permits there have been on federal lands this year, up from 60% in 2018 and 2019 - evidence of companies trying to ""fast track"" permits on federal acreage, Abramov said. Meanwhile, permits on state and private lands, which features similar geology, have fallen.New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, has said she would ask for a waiver exempting it from any drilling bans. The state is one of the nation's poorest, and a third of the state's budget comes from oil and gas revenues. Around 65% of New Mexico production is on federal acreage.Matador and EOG have been two of the most aggressive in adding federal permits in New Mexico.Matador expects to have 300 federal permits by late 2020.""We think the chances of them saying you can't drill on your leasehold are fairly slim,"" CEO Joseph Foran told analysts in July.Its new federal permits in two key New Mexico counties that are among the most prolific in the Permian Basin are up 149% so far this year, compared with its 2019 total, according to Rystad.EOG's permits in those same New Mexico counties, Eddy and Lea, are up 49% so far this year compared with all of 2019, according to Rystad.EOG has 2,500 permits on federal lands in four states approved or in the works, enough for four years, Chief Operating Officer Lloyd Helms said on an earnings call.The industry has secured so many permits that investors and analysts have largely shrugged off the political risks of a federal fracking ban.""I'm not sure if it would have the big impact that people are making it out to be,"" said Rob Thummel, energy portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.(Reporting by Jennifer Hiller in Houston; Editing by David Gaffen and Marguerita Choy)",finance.yahoo.com,1
11505,CMCSA,Feb-17-21,02:17PM,"'Studios will keep financing' quality, diverse projects: Will Packer Productions President", Yahoo Finance Video,"Will Packer Productions President James F. Lopez joins Yahoo Finance's Kristin Myers to break down his outlook on diversity in film, and how movie theaters with fare post COVID-19.Video TranscriptKRISTIN MYERS: Welcome back to Yahoo Finance Live. Now, the film industry has been heavily impacted by the pandemic, while audiences have really been demanding greater diversity in stories and film talent that they are going to be seeing on screen. So let's talk outlook for this sector and more with James Lopez, President at Will Packer Productions. James, thanks so much for joining us today for this conversation.So I want to start with the outlook looking forward. I'm wondering when you think the film industry will be back to normal, so to speak, or do you think that the film industry has been forever changed by this pandemic?JAMES LOPEZ: You know, it's hard to predict. Obviously, life gets back to normal as more vaccine rolls out and herd immunity is achieved. I happen to think that there are audiences out there that are clamoring to get back into theaters. We've been locked in our homes for over a year, close to a year now. And I just have to believe that once we come out of this, the, the appetite for in-person entertainment and getting out of the home will be fervent. That same goes for live music and just public gathering in general.So I happen to think that the theaters will come back. And it's all about the content that's being offered. You know, the-- obviously the movies that will be more of eventized, the big tentpole projects, will continue as in the past. The question will be, what is the threshold for a film that is theatrical worthy versus streaming, because obviously during this pandemic a lot of habits in terms of viewing have been formed. So some of those may be harder to, to break, or in terms of what types of programming people are willing to leave the home for.But as a whole, as an industry, I have to believe that theaters are going to bounce back, because I for one am clamoring to go back into a theater. I can't wait to go back to a venue to watch my favorite bands and artists perform. So I have a very positive outlook.Story continuesKRISTIN MYERS: I want to very quickly ask you this question, because I want to move on to diversity in this space. But do you think then that we're going to see a lot more films taking the root of a movie like ""Tenet"", for example, which did do a very short release in theaters and then went straight direct-to-consumer and was available on streaming platforms.JAMES LOPEZ: I do believe so. I believe you're going to see a lot of, of differences in terms of windowing. You're going to see a lot shorter windows in theaters. You know, the studios and the streaming platforms will have to strike some overall deals with the exhibitors so that there's a happy medium that, that basically benefits both platforms. I think because of the pandemic, like I said before, there's a lot of habits that have been formed, and we have to adjust as an industry. Just like streaming, you know, and digital downloading affected the music industry a decade ago, the television and film industry is going to have to adjust as well.So you will see different-- you will see different windowing strategies, depending on the projects.KRISTIN MYERS: And I don't know if you understood ""Tenet,"" and if you do, I hope you and I can chat later so you can explain it to me, because I still don't get it, and I've read a couple of explainers. So I want to move on to diversity in this space. Will Packer Productions, as you can see over your shoulder, responsible for some films that I have loved in recent years. ""Girls Trip"" is one, ""Little"" is another. ""The Photograph"" I recently watched. I'm wondering how you imagined diversity in this space moving forward. Are we at a point where really film studios can no longer get away with or act as if it's not profitable to only tell white stories with only white actors?JAMES LOPEZ: Absolutely. You know, I think it's a business decision, and you know, at the end of the day, it's all about the green. And when you have projects that are proven to be profitable, the studios chase those same dynamics for future projects. So it's all about the performance of the content that's being produced. As soon as they stop working, you're going to see a drawback, but I don't think they're going to stop working. It's been proven over and over that diversity sells. And as long as you have a quality project and there's diversity in front and behind the camera, they're going to-- the studios will keep financing those projects.And it's good business all around. It's been proven over and over. The biggest hurdle has been international, and those barriers are slowly breaking down as well. So it's all about the green, you know. Let's not fool ourselves and say it's all altruistic. It isn't. Studios, you know, it's a business. And as long as you continually have successful projects with diversity in them, you will continue to see more. And it's up to us as producers and content creators to keep providing that quality content and making sure that the studios and the, the financiers are getting their return of investment.So it's a business. It's been long overdue. And as long as the diversity continues in terms of thought, in terms of story, the audiences will become more and more accustomed to seeing people who look different.KRISTIN MYERS: I'm so glad you mentioned that, because for a long time, it was said that women aren't funny, and then to see a cast like ""Girls Trip"" led by black women being, not just funny, hilarious, and performing well, was, I think, really just shattered a lot of those expectations. Really quickly for you here,James, I'm curious to know your thoughts on representation when it comes to African-Americans versus other actors as a part of the diaspora. This was an argument and a debate that came up for example when ""Harriet"" came out, when Cynthia Erivo took on that role. We hear a lot more black actors saying you know what some of our Black American heroes and historical figures should be portrayed by African-Americans, Black American actors. What's your take on that?JAMES LOPEZ: Well, I happen to be very close friends with a lot of actors across the diaspora, Nigerians, Brits, obviously Americans, and I have very spirited discussions about this subject with a lot of them. And, you know, did anyone pause when Forrest Whitaker played Idi Amin and was nominated for an Oscar? You know, we have to get over these issues within our own community. The best actor for the job should play the role, period. That is my opinion as a content producer.So I don't want Africans saying to African-Americans, hey, you cannot play Nelson Mandela, for, you know, Morgan Freeman. That should not be. I think the producers, the filmmaker, the studio, have to put forth the best cast possible for these projects, and if they happen to be not of that country, I think it's OK. As long as everyone gets a fair shot to read or audition or be in the discussion. Now if there is a barrier to entry for, say, African-American actors not even getting the opportunity, that's an issue. But if the best person wins out, then I have no issue with that.KRISTIN MYERS: All right, James Lopez, President at Will Packer Productions. I could have had another half hour long chat with you, however I know my producer absolutely would not allow me to do that. We just unfortunately ran out of time. Thank you so much for joining us for this discussion.",finance.yahoo.com,0

4242,GM,Feb-12-21,06:42PM,UPDATE 1-GM agrees to $5.75 mln settlement with California over ignition switches, Reuters,"(Adds comments by state attorney general, company background)By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - General Motors Coagreed to a $5.75 million settlement to resolve allegations itmade false statements to California's largest pension system andother investors over its deadly ignition switch recalls.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the largestU.S. automaker concealed problems from investors related tofaulty ignition switches linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuriesGM failed to build reserves for losses it knew were coming,Becerra said, which artificially inflated GM's stock price andcaused the California Public Employees’ Retirement System orCalPERS to lose millions of dollars.GM previously paid about $2.6 billion in total penalties andfines tied to the ignition switch issue, including $900 millionto settle a U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation and$1 million to resolve a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionaccounting case.GM said it was ""pleased to have cooperated with the state ofCalifornia to resolve this matter.""""General Motors cheated California twice – first byconcealing a fatal flaw in its vehicles, then by concealing thefacts about the flaw in its financial disclosures, whichaffected the retirement investments of public servants acrossCalifornia,"" Becerra said.GM in 2017 agreed to pay $120 million to resolve claims from49 U.S. states and the District of Columbia over the ignitionswitches.The faulty ignition switches that could cause engines tostall and prevent airbags from deploying in crashes prompted arecall that began in February 2014 of 2.6 million vehicles.The states said GM knew as early as 2004 that the ignitionswitch posed a safety defect because it could cause airbagnon-deployment. It was alleged that company officials decided itwas not a safety concern and they delayed recalls.Last year GM agreed to a $120 million settlement with ownerswho said defective ignition switches caused their vehicles tolose value.(Reporting by David Shepardson in WashingtonEditing by Chris Reese and Matthew Lewis)",finance.yahoo.com,-1
561,ATVI,Feb-03-21,12:10PM,"Will Activision Blizzard, Inc (ATVI) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?", Zacks,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Activision Blizzard, Inc (ATVI), which belongs to the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 26.79%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, Activision Blizzard, Inc came out with earnings of $0.71 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.64 per share, representing a surprise of 10.94%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.68 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.97 per share, delivering a surprise of 42.65%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for Activision Blizzard, Inc. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Activision Blizzard, Inc has an Earnings ESP of +1.58% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on February 4, 2021.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

11943,ED,Sep-23-20,12:47PM,Mountain Valley seeks U.S. OK to restart work on WV-VA natgas pipe, Reuters,"Sept 23 (Reuters) - Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC asked federal regulators for permission to resume construction on the $5.4-$5.7 billion pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia by Sept. 25.Mountain Valley said that would allow it to complete as many activities as possible before winter, according to a filing with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) late on Tuesday.FERC suspended work on Mountain Valley in October 2019 due to litigation over the project's Biological Opinion from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which allows the project to work in areas inhabited by endangered and threatened species.The FWS issued a new Biological Opinion in early September.Analysts at ClearView Energy Partners said on Wednesday they expect FERC will allow Mountain Valley to resume construction even though some environmental groups and others will oppose the return to work and the new Biological Opinion.U.S. pipeline company Equitrans Midstream Corp, one of the partners in Mountain Valley, said in early September it expects the pipeline to enter service in early 2021.Mountain Valley is one of several U.S. oil and gas pipelines delayed by regulatory and legal fights with environmental and local groups that found problems with federal permits issued by the Trump administration.In February 2018, when Equitrans started construction of the 303-mile (488-km) pipeline designed to deliver 2 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale, it estimated Mountain Valley would cost about $3.5 billion and be completed by the end of 2018.Equitrans has said it expects to receive new approvals soon from FERC and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that will enable it to finish building the last 8% of the project.Mountain Valley is owned by units of Equitrans, NextEra Energy Inc, Consolidated Edison Inc, AltaGas Ltd and RGC Resources Inc.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Tom Brown)",finance.yahoo.com,0

3013,AXP,Feb-08-21,09:48AM,Palantir Surges on Deal to Offer Software Through IBM, Bloomberg,"(Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. are uniting in a partnership that will dramatically expand the reach of Palantir’s sales force while making IBM’s own artificial-intelligence software easier for non-technical customers to use, the companies plan to announce Monday.The global partnership is the largest of its kind for Palantir, the maker of data-analysis software whose shares have more than quadrupled since its September debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Palantir gains access to a sales team of more than 2,500 people, up from its current 30. Palantir’s stock rose 10% as trading opened in New York Monday, boosting the shares to $37.53.The relationship is the payday for the project Palantir started more than a year ago to break its data integration and analysis software into smaller, less pricey modules. The Denver-based company mainly sells to companies with revenue in excess of $500 million -- many of which already have relationships with IBM.Reselling Palantir’s software to augment the data and AI tools that IBM already offers and make them easier for more people to use was “a natural” fit, said Rob Thomas, IBM’s senior vice president of software, cloud and data. “We’re going to sell it to 180 countries and thousands of customers.”Palantir’s software requires little to no coding, enabling less technical employees to use it, Thomas said. To expand IBM’s cloud and AI business, half the revenue will need to come through partnerships like the one struck with Palantir. “That’s a pretty fundamental change for us,” he said.Expanded AccessWithout providing a time frame, Thomas said he expects the partnership to help boost IBM’s customers using AI to 80% from its current 20%.Palantir Chief Operating Officer Shyam Sankar said the technical fit with IBM and its reach are part of his company’s long-term effort to finally ramp sales. In addition to commercial customers, government contracts have surged both in number and size during the pandemic.Story continues“This is the biggest [partnership] we’ve announced -- expect more,” Sankar said. He said he expects to triple Palantir’s direct-sales team to about 100 this year, a significant hike for a company whose management once prided itself on not employing a single salesperson.Started with funding from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel in 2003, Palantir found early success with users at the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and went on to sign the Defense Department and Internal Revenue Service, which, respectively, have used the software to locate roadside bombs and hunt tax cheats.Government ContractsMore recently the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention use Palantir’s software to help predict Covid-19 outbreaks, distribute protective gear and allocate vaccines.While Palantir’s government contracts have grown -- sometimes amid privacy and surveillance concerns -- the company’s commercial business has been slower to evolve.Palantir last reported 132 total government and commercial clients, a concentrated pool that includes BP Plc, Merck KGaA and Airbus SE. Early customers like American Express Co. and Coca-Cola Co. which experimented with low-cost Palantir software trials and later ditched them, aren’t necessarily top of Palantir’s list now, Sankar said.“We hope to win all this business back in the fullness of time,” Sankar said, adding there is no “pride list” of former customers it hopes to now re-engage.Palantir reports financial results for 2020 on Feb. 16. A shareholder lockup expires three days later, unleashing the remaining 80% of all shares that have not been eligible to trade. Palantir shares rose $2 to $34.05 on Feb. 5, giving it a stock-market value of $59.3 billion.(Updates with shares in the second paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",finance.yahoo.com,1
1652,ARE,Sep-04-20,11:45AM,Why Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is a Great Dividend Stock Right Now, Zacks,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio, whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities. But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Alexandria Real Estate Equities in FocusHeadquartered in Pasadena, Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE) is a Finance stock that has seen a price change of 4.95% so far this year. Currently paying a dividend of $1.06 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.5%. In comparison, the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield is 3.79%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.62%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $4.24 is up 6% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Alexandria Real Estate Equities has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.25%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Alexandria Real Estate Equities's current payout ratio is 59%, meaning it paid out 59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, ARE expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2020 is $7.55 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 8.48%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, ARE is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following: the current or future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Catalent’s and its clients’ businesses; participation in a highly competitive market and increased competition that may adversely affect Catalent’s business; demand for Catalent’s offerings, which depends in part on Catalent’s customers’ research and development and the clinical and market success of their products; product and other liability risks that could adversely affect Catalent’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows; failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements; failure to provide quality offerings to customers could have an adverse effect on Catalent’s business and subject it to regulatory actions and costly litigation; problems providing the highly exacting and complex services or support required; global economic, political and regulatory risks to the operations of Catalent; inability to enhance existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner; inadequate patents, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property protections; fluctuations in the costs, availability, and suitability of the components of the products Catalent manufactures, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, purchased components and raw materials; changes in market access or healthcare reimbursement in the United States or internationally; fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, including as a result of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union; adverse tax, legislative or regulatory initiatives or challenges or adjustments to Catalent’s tax positions; loss of key personnel; risks generally associated with information systems; inability to complete any future acquisitions or other transactions that may complement or expand Catalent’s business or divest of non-strategic businesses or assets and difficulties in successfully integrating acquired businesses and realizing anticipated benefits of such acquisitions; risks associated with timely and successfully completing, and correctly anticipating the future demand predicted for, capital expansion projects at existing or any acquired facilities, offerings and customers’ products that may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could increase costs and restrict operations; labor and employment laws and regulations or labor difficulties, which could increase costs or result in operational disruptions; additional cash contributions required to fund Catalent’s existing pension plans; substantial leverage resulting in the limited ability of Catalent to raise additional capital to fund operations and react to changes in the economy or in the industry; and exposure to interest-rate risk to the extent of Catalent’s variable-rate debt preventing Catalent from meeting its obligations under its indebtedness.

4219,PGR,Sep-28-20,06:23AM,"Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: National General Holdings, The Progressive Corp, Arthur J. Gallagher and American Financial Group", Zacks,"For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – September 28, 2020 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Insurance - Property & Casualty,including National General Holdings Corp. NGHC,The Progressive Corporation PGR, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. AJG and American Financial Group, Inc. AFG.Link: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1063709/4-lowbeta-insurance-stocks-to-beat-market-volatilityThe insurance industry has been bearing the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic, near-zero interest rates, trade tariffs and inflation rate. The industry has declined 17.2% year to date against the S&P 500 composite’s increase of 0.8%.A low interest rate environment makes insurers prone to interest rate risks. Life insurers, earnings, capital, reserves and liquidity are affected as their earnings are typically derived from the spread between their investment returns and what they credit as interest on insurance policies and products.A near-zero interest rate is also a concern for long-tail Property and Casualty Insurance providers. The rate environment is expected to remain low in a range of 0-0.25%. No improvement in rates is expected before 2023 as outlined in the September FOMC meeting. Also, investment income, a component of insurers’ top line, is likely to remain under pressure.P&C or non-life insurers are exposed to catastrophes that induce volatility in underwriting profits. Colorado State University predicts an ‘extremely active Atlantic hurricane season in 2020 and hurricane activity will be about 190% of the average season.’ However, improved pricing (most of the lines are witnessing rate increase), prudent underwriting, favorable reserve development and sturdy capital level should help withstand the blow.On the other hand, life insurers have been refraining from selling long duration term life insurance, moving away from guaranteed savings products toward protection products of unit-linked savings products in their efforts to maintain sales and profitability.Story continuesSocial distancing norms have led to increased automation, which is expected to ensure smooth functioning, in turn driving premiums and efficiency. Adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, cognitive intelligence or blockchain should help life insurers curb operational costs and aid margin expansion.Amid the current situation, let’s focus on some low-beta insurance stocks that tend to deliver steady performance irrespective of market conditions.What is Beta?Beta indicates the volatility of a particular stock with respect to the market. In other words, beta measures the extent of stock price movement relative to the market.If a company has a beta of 1, it means that the relative volatility of the stock is the same as that of the market. In the same way, if the stock's beta is greater than 1, then it is more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta below 1 signifies low volatility.In a turbulent market, it is advisable to focus on low-beta stocks as these will ensure steady return on investment.The Winning StrategyWe have used our proprietary Zacks Stock Screener to find out stocks that can deliver steady performance even in times of uncertainty. We have included stocks with beta less than 1 for shortlisting low-risk stocks. But low beta cannot be the only stock selection criterion. So, we have added a few other parameters:Percentage Change in Price in the Last 12 Weeks greater than 1: This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last three months.Average 20 Day Volume greater than 400,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable.Zacks Rank equal to 3: Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.VGM Score of A or B: The selected stocks have a VGM Score of A or B.Insurers in FocusNew York, NY-based National General Holdings provides various insurance products and services in the United States, Bermuda, Luxembourg, and Sweden.
